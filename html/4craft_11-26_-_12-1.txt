2:05 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: sorta
2:05 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Rearranged shit from v1
2:05 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And basically remade every single island
2:06 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Actually wait
2:06 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I rearranged shit for v6
2:06 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: not v5
2:06 PM - Pip: should prob just reused v5/v6 map
2:06 PM - Pip: reuse*
2:06 PM - Pip: eath map would be nice
2:07 PM - Pip: but you would spend more time making it than 4craft v7 would last
2:07 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: the v5 map was so fucking good
2:07 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Dude v6 was basically the same map
2:07 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Except with less ocean
2:07 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: all that hype i think made it great

2:08 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: :^)
2:08 PM - Pip: another good thing about the traditional 4craft maps is they are great for viraling
2:08 PM - Pip: when people see the islands representing their board it makes them want to play more
2:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: w/e dude
2:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It'll be cheaper to use it sure
2:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But if you want to move ANY island around
2:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Like I did from v5 to v6
2:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I have to repaint ALL biomes
2:10 PM - Pip: just use v5 map
2:10 PM - Pip: the exact same one
2:10 PM - Pip: no edits
2:10 PM - Pip: there was nothing wrong with it

2:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: From talking to Coty
2:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Prior, he's not on right now
2:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: The entire deal is if he doesn't get money, he doesn't make a plan
2:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Idiot doesn't realize if he doesn't make a plan, he doesn't make money
2:17 PM - Pip: i already donated 10 shekels

2:18 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: >gib money for possible future
2:18 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: donate to my patreon while you are at it

2:18 PM - D.J - Fred: >wanting money from investors without having any plan
2:18 PM - D.J - Fred: brilliant
2:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He apparently does have a bit of a plan
2:19 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: >tfw SaiLE was Coty all along
2:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But it's not complete
2:19 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: >tfw I was the milkman
2:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Shame Lemon isn't on
2:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He could tell you all about Saile's shenanigans
2:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And lies
2:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He didn't join the Chairforce
2:20 PM - Pip: do we really need $250
2:20 PM - Pip: i know we should have a good server
2:20 PM - Pip: but that seems like a lot
2:21 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Also he claims he was raped as a child now
2:21 PM - Pip: need the exact same server we got in v5
2:21 PM - Pip: later on
2:21 PM - D.J - Fred: >not getting a server from based Charles
2:21 PM - Pip: didnt he give on for free?
2:21 PM - Pip: one*
2:22 PM - Thor entered chat.
2:22 PM - Thor: ?
2:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thor these dildos are impatient about your evil plan with Coty
2:23 PM - Zealous: ??????????
2:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Sell your shit
2:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Because Pip apparently has a pile of money he bathes in
2:23 PM - Pip: >setup fee
2:23 PM - Pip: >$129
2:23 PM - Pip: that must be why
2:24 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So be a good little jew
2:24 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And try to scam people
2:24 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: :^)
2:24 PM - Pip: i dont have a pile of money
2:24 PM - Pip: i dont want to donate 100% of the cost
2:24 PM - Thor: Well
2:24 PM - Thor: Coty has everything he needs to run the server, other than a server
2:24 PM - Pip: too many neets on 4chan
2:25 PM - Pip: does he really need $250?
2:25 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (he could buy a weaker server but if we get too much hype we'll overfill it
2:25 PM - Pip: IF SOMEONE DONATES 50$ in the next 5 minutes
2:25 PM - Thor: The 250 figure is based on what we would need to have a good amount of server power for the length of time that 4craft generally goes
2:25 PM - Pip: i will match it and donate $50 also
2:26 PM - Pip: we will be almost 50% of the way there
2:26 PM - Pip: oy vey anti semites
2:26 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I should donate $50 then pull it
2:26 PM - Pip: give up your shekels
2:26 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: and yeah
2:26 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thor
2:26 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Sell them on the seekrit plan
2:26 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Because right now you fucks are going "gibe us money for plan"
2:27 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Rather than "here is plan gibe us money"
2:27 PM - Thor: Theres no real secret plan dude
2:27 PM - Thor: 4craft is a continual expirement in trying to get it to work
2:27 PM - Pip: hey how much does ad banner on 4chan cost?
2:27 PM - Pip: we could market 4craft
2:27 PM - Thor: Each iteration has been done slightly differently than the previous one to try and give it some longevity
2:28 PM - Thor: we've tried that
2:28 PM - Thor: M00t told us off
2:28 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (my solution is the only way)
2:28 PM - Pip: what a
2:28 PM - Pip: faggot
2:28 PM - Delay: and then you decide to throw that all away to go anarchy :^)
2:28 PM - Thor: We've jumped away from the anarchy idea
2:28 PM - Zealous: stof tried paid advertising and it didn't work at all
2:28 PM - Delay: amazing, do tell
2:28 PM - Thor: Initially we thought anarchy would be a fun change of pace for everything
2:28 PM - Delay: like seriously, I don't hear shit
2:29 PM - Thor: Since the most enjoyable part of 4craft is whenno one knows what the fuck is actually happening
2:29 PM - Thor: so you know
2:29 PM - Thor: you try and extend it
2:29 PM - Thor: groups have to organize for themselves
2:29 PM - Thor: we don't spoon feed them everything
2:29 PM - Delay: I have a setup just for that sitting in a folder btw
2:29 PM - Delay: but it's overcomplicated
2:29 PM - Thor: but of course that was shot down by the population
2:30 PM - Thor: what can you do right
2:30 PM - Thor: So we're just looking for a way to make it interesting
2:30 PM - Thor: but not have it be the same shit
2:30 PM - Thor: because pro tip
2:30 PM - Thor: the same shit hasn't worked
2:30 PM - Delay: no no, this was something else
2:31 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: There was my plan
2:31 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: but I'm too lazy to actually do it
2:31 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Because it'd require massive overhauls to Minecraft itself
2:31 PM - Thor: Yeah
2:31 PM - Thor: we've had similar ideas
2:31 PM - Delay: but it would be difficult to market
2:31 PM - Thor: But working them into a format that is compatible with the game is insanely difficult for something of our size
2:32 PM - Thor: because we don't have the talent to do it
2:32 PM - Thor: nor do we have the money to pay people
2:32 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: bretty sure Coty knows about the Node idea
2:32 PM - Thor: i believe he does

2:38 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: so yeah faggot
2:38 PM - Thor: the best thing for 4craft advertising
2:38 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thor, did he mention Node
2:38 PM - Thor: is shilling it on 8chan as well
2:38 PM - Thor: briefly yea
2:38 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: >not asking hotwheels or /v/ mods for ad space
2:38 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: good
2:38 PM - Pip: so moot wouldnt take our money?
2:38 PM - Pip: or did we ask for free?
2:38 PM - Thor: he wouldn't
2:38 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Hotcakes said he could make threads on other boards already
2:38 PM - Pip: thats all we need
2:39 PM - Thor: said that we've done too much rule breaking shit

4:36 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: d20 is also shit
4:36 PM - Nowvember: It's a /tg/ offshoot, but it's the oldest /tg/ server I know.
4:36 PM - Nowvember: There's one that advertises on /tg/ proper still, but they seem like young guns.
4:37 PM - Shlomo Shekelstein entered chat.
4:37 PM - Nowvember: I like /tg/station. It's a good mix of roleplay and dicking around. I've been on it for about four years now.
4:38 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: ROLEPLAY?
4:38 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: ON /TG?
4:38 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: OH WOW
4:39 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: You implying something boy?
4:39 PM - Nowvember: What?
4:39 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: A good mix of roleplay makes SS13 playable
4:40 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: Except the last thing /tg/ has is roleplay
4:40 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: it's literally a deathmatch, space edition
4:40 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: Now /vg/station was good.
4:40 PM - Nowvember: Pfffft
4:41 PM - Nowvember: /vg/station was a deathmatch station where the admins would intervene directly if they didn't like who was winning the current fight.
4:41 PM - Nowvember: Yakkety sax in the brig? Let's get rid of those flash-resistant sunglasses.
4:41 PM - Nowvember: He's still going? Teleport in a secborg with wiped laws.
4:41 PM - Nowvember: He's flashed it and beat it to death? Ban he.
4:41 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Ribbs time
4:42 PM - Nowvember: I think you're thinking of Goonstation when it comes to deathmatching.
4:42 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: Quit lying, nigger.
4:42 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: Who do you think you're fooling here?
4:43 PM - Nowvember: Hey, I was there.
4:43 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: I personally managed to talk myself out of three permabans.
4:43 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: they're lax and the playerbase is good.
4:43 PM - Great Mazinger: ok I was taking a shit
4:43 PM - Great Mazinger: whats going on
4:44 PM - Great Mazinger: monkey we gonna play spess engineers soon
4:45 PM - Nowvember: Admittedly this was at least a year back, but still, being essentially kicked out of the server within twenty minutes of joining because a security officer took umbridge with the way I left the arrivals shuttle and it escalated from there.
4:46 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: That sounds retarded, I've been playing on vg for two years straight and never witnessed such bullshit unfold.
4:46 PM - Nowvember: Mm. May it was two years. It's been some time, at least.
4:46 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: 2 years ago, /vg/station was /v/station, buddy.
4:47 PM - Nowvember: So different people?
4:47 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: Exactly.
4:47 PM - Nowvember: I heard there was a change in adminship.
4:47 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: Like five times.
4:47 PM - Delay: http://puu.sh/d318N/1ddf164301.png
4:47 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah /m/
4:49 PM - Nowvember: Well, if it works for you, then enjoy. But it left a bad taste in my mouth in my one and only attempt.

5:08 PM - Delay: Thor and Coty are the ones taking care of it
5:08 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: its monkeys fault
5:08 PM - Delay: Thor just said that we aren't going anarchy route anymore when he noticed us complaining about it
5:08 PM - Delay: and then nothing
5:08 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: hes the scapegoat this version

5:11 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Oh whats the IP to v7 btw?
5:11 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Anyone know it?
5:12 PM - Delay: probably gonna be 4craft.us or something again
5:12 PM - Delay: Coty always lets 'official' 4crafts use it
5:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: You mean 4crafts not4craft
5:13 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: And uhh what was the last one
5:13 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Wernt offical?
5:14 PM - Delay: not4craft was not 4craft technically
5:14 PM - ScienceGaveMeAH/a/dron: smart man ^
5:14 PM - Delay: afaik the only official ones are v1 - v6
5:15 PM - Garry, The Payne in the butt: what the fuck is an official 4craft
5:15 PM - Delay: it's not like anyone actually owns the concept though
5:15 PM - Delay: so there's technically nothing 'official' about any of this
5:15 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: I mean I guess /b/ owns the concept.
5:15 PM - Delay: nor does anyone actually own 4craft
5:15 PM - Delay: the concept is old as fuck
5:15 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Wasnt that the first board to have the whole 4chan on an island quest thing?
5:16 PM - Delay: based on 4chan island thread
5:16 PM - Delay: s
5:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Yeah I forget which board it was on
5:16 PM - Delay: does it matter?
5:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: I mean started with.
5:16 PM - Delay: probably
5:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Well that board would be the "owners" of the idea
5:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: As a concept anyway
5:16 PM - Delay: I don't agree
5:17 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Im not saying owners in the sense that they can take it away from people, but more they own the base idea.
5:17 PM - Delay: can't you just say they thought of it?
5:17 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: I guess own is a poor term for this.
5:17 PM - Delay: ratherthan go on about ownership
5:18 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Nix own replace with forefather
5:19 PM - Delay: whatever, man
5:19 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: They are the forefathers to the concept of 4craft I guess is what is better.
5:19 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Hey its an interesting little thing the origins of ideas.
5:19 PM - Delay: but when you think about the kind of place /b/ is, it's really hard to think of it that way
5:20 PM - Delay: and the way imageboards work
5:20 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Well like lets use /tg/ as an exmpale since Im not talking out my ass for this one.
5:20 PM - Delay: I'd rather say "The concept originated in..."
5:20 PM - Delay: rather than "/b/ was the forefather of the concept"
5:20 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: Yeah your wording is better.
5:21 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: It would be interesting to see how each boards version of 4chan island turned out to be.
5:21 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: But that would require a ton of just dreding the logs.
5:21 PM - Delay: iirc that phrase is what know your maymay uses
5:22 PM - Delay: >no more 4chan islands threads
5:22 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: They pop up atleast on /tg/ before 4craft anyway.
5:22 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: OH god did 4craft kill 4chan island for everyone as a concept?
5:23 PM - Delay: probably
5:23 PM - Delay: or at least took over
5:23 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: That saddens me slightly that we killed an idea.
5:23 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/ IT BEGINS AGAIN: I mean expresion of an idea.
5:24 PM - Delay: >/b/ island full of children and normalfags
5:24 PM - Delay: /v/ island full of children and normalfags who were playing videogames

11:04 AM - StruttingB4: PURPOSE
11:04 AM - Dante: ahh
11:05 AM - Dante: if i just had the remove admin copypasta
11:05 AM - Mawr: FOR FREE
11:05 AM - Archevei: if you havent noticed like kobe
11:05 AM - Archevei: people that hold onto 4craft because its their brainchild
11:05 AM - Dante: Make me mod and we can call it even
11:05 AM - Dante: R-right
11:05 AM - Archevei: is frowned upon
11:05 AM - Archevei: you seem to forget about memeclay and how you shilled that he would make "bad things happen" or some bullshit
11:05 AM - Dante: also
11:05 AM - Archevei: don't deny it because there's screens of it
11:05 AM - Dante: >only 7 votes
11:06 AM - Coty: well
11:06 AM - Coty: To be fair, Thor doesn't do that
11:06 AM - Archevei: he is like
11:06 AM - Archevei: a meme quarterback
11:06 AM - Archevei: probably does it for free
11:06 AM - Coty: he holds onto the steam group so it doesn't get demolished by somebody
11:06 AM - Coty: but he hasn't interfered with any 4craft iteration he wasn't a part of
11:06 AM - StruttingB4: please
11:06 AM - StruttingB4: make patch
11:06 AM - Coty: I'd say he's done a good job of letting people do whatever
11:06 AM - StruttingB4: showrunner
11:06 AM - StruttingB4: pkls
11:06 AM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Thor is preaty chill mate.
11:06 AM - Archevei: what we really need to do
11:06 AM - Archevei: is kill all the other
11:06 AM - StruttingB4: he is the only one he can be impartial
11:06 AM - Archevei: 4craft groups
11:06 AM - Archevei: and reboot one of them
11:06 AM - StruttingB4: who isnt a faggot
11:06 AM - Coty: I'd have no problem with patch in charge; but he hasn't asked
11:06 AM - Delay: Thor refused to let us use the steamgroup for v5 because he wasn't taking part in it then ended up fucking with betaclay's already fragile mind
11:06 AM - Archevei: ^
11:07 AM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Oh V5~
11:07 AM - Coty: that wasn't true though
11:07 AM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: That was one of the more fun maps
11:07 AM - Coty: betaclay made the whole thing up
11:07 AM - Coty: supposedly
11:07 AM - Archevei: >memeclay
11:07 AM - Archevei: and then you supported him
11:07 AM - Archevei: after he got BTFO
11:07 AM - Coty: he made the entire ruse so that people would be mad at thor, to hype up 4craft with fake drama
11:07 AM - Coty: like a false flag, basically
11:07 AM - Archevei: >shilling
11:07 AM - Coty: I don't remember ever supporting betaclay in anything
11:08 AM - Delay: Still don't like thor, just dislike betaclay more if that's true
11:08 AM - Delay: archevei do you remember anything regarding v5 and us trying to get to advertise on this group?
11:08 AM - Coty: I was just sitting back laughing at the whole thing
11:08 AM - Coty: thor was as well
11:09 AM - Dante: Remove admin ?
11:09 AM - Archevei: yeah
11:09 AM - Dante: you are worst admin
11:09 AM - Archevei: some fag was in charge here that i can't remember
11:09 AM - Dante: you are admin smell
11:09 AM - Delay: I wasn't involved in that
11:09 AM - Dante: wow i can smell it
11:09 AM - Archevei: so we made the other one
11:09 AM - Delay: was it spaceballs?
11:09 AM - Archevei: and the mods in this one that madmined in the second group
11:09 AM - Archevei: advertised on this one and then BTFO'd
11:09 AM - Archevei: it was memesinspace
11:09 AM - Delay: he was in charge of something, I don't remember what
11:09 AM - Archevei: and memeballs
11:09 AM - Archevei: and myself, kek
11:09 AM - Archevei: i never had mod or anything on this group though
11:09 AM - Archevei: only on the 2014 group
11:10 AM - Coty: I know a lot of people dislike spaceballs, but I've never got to really talk to him
11:10 AM - Coty: I have no clue what he did
11:10 AM - Delay: you were just server money
11:10 AM - Archevei: mone

11:16 AM - Delay: How about this
11:16 AM - Coty: for example, "I hate betaclay because he abused his admin powers and almost destroyed v5"
11:16 AM - Delay: You give reasons why he should be on.
11:16 AM - Dante: Ok

11:18 AM - Coty: Good question. Thor, what would you be doing as Admin of v7?

11:41 AM - Coty: only reason I didn't put it on spigot's page yet is because I haven't tried compiling it against spigot yet

11:43 AM - Coty: seriously though guys
11:43 AM - Coty: slime didn't make much money
11:43 AM - Thor: Why not Charles
11:43 AM - Coty: only enough to cover the server
11:43 AM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: We have a ts?
11:43 AM - Coty: iirc
11:43 AM - Archevei: charles won't be involved
11:43 AM - Archevei: but he'll let me
11:43 AM - Archevei: buy out one of his servers
11:43 AM - Archevei: for 4crust
11:43 AM - Archevei: and i'll pay for it
11:44 AM - D.J - Fred: charles will save 4craft
11:44 AM - Delay: ask for a coolguy discount
11:44 AM - Snowman: http://reddit.com/r/CharlesBroughton
11:44 AM - Dante: Charles will save 4craft ?
11:44 AM - Dante: I already did
11:44 AM - Dante: ;^)
11:45 AM - Coty: I'll never understand the charlesposting
11:45 AM - Thor: It's a dumb may may
11:46 AM - Thor: orchestrated entirely by strub
11:46 AM - Thor: :^)
11:46 AM - Archevei: implying
11:46 AM - Archevei: i am the true meme master
11:46 AM - Snowman: I did more about it
11:46 AM - Snowman: I made a lot of meme pictures
11:47 AM - Delay: so about that server
11:47 AM - D.J - Fred: are we getting 4craft before or after new years?
11:47 AM - Delay: what plugins
11:47 AM - Coty: hopefully before
11:47 AM - Delay: what do?
11:47 AM - Coty: simplefactions for sure, not sure about anything else yet.
11:47 AM - Delay: I need to know so I can complain
11:48 AM - Delay: did you look at the zip I sent you?
11:48 AM - Coty: we might not even use Essentials this time around
11:48 AM - harbl entered chat.
11:48 AM - Coty: because anything essentials does I can program simplefactions to do
11:48 AM - Snowman: Why use simple factions, why not use ADVANCED factions

11:48 AM - Coty: including things like /tpa and /spawn
11:48 AM - Coty: I really want to add in /tpa again
11:48 AM - Delay: but then again
11:48 AM - Delay: why would you do that?
11:48 AM - Coty: the only reason it was removed was because we had Runecraft, but we stopped using that after v4
11:49 AM - Delay: I say leave essentials to essentials
11:49 AM - Coty: tl;dr harbl
11:49 AM - Delay: there's also all the shit that relies on essentials
11:49 AM - Delay: like group manager
11:49 AM - Coty: but depending on our plugins, we might not need it
11:49 AM - Coty: simplefactions can run entirely without permissions
11:50 AM - Delay: even if it can
11:50 AM - Delay: would we want to?
11:50 AM - Coty: why not
11:50 AM - Coty: hey do any of you fags play smash
11:50 AM - Coty: I have it on wii u and have put nearly 30 hours into it so far
11:50 AM - Delay: permissions are kind of important for configuring and implementing some plugins
11:50 AM - Coty: yeah, just depends on our plugin setup

11:54 AM - Delay: they were the fun
11:54 AM - Mawr: 19:48 - Coty: including things like /tpa and /spawn
19:48 - Coty: I really want to add in /tpa again
19:48 - Delay: but then again
19:48 - Delay: why would you do that?
19:48 - Coty: the only reason it was removed was because we had Runecraft, but we stopped using that after v4
11:54 AM - Mawr: ayyy
11:54 AM - Delay: whoa
11:54 AM - Mawr: server balance guy aka coty
11:54 AM - Mawr: strikes again!
11:54 AM - Delay: I wasn't referring to that aat all
11:54 AM - Dante: Proofs?
11:55 AM - Delay: I was referring to programming essentials features into simplefactions
11:56 AM - Delay: >tpa removed because of runecraft
11:56 AM - Delay: that shit was gone from v1
11:56 AM - Delay: like halfway through beta I think
11:58 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And it made it suck
11:59 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Combat was too slo
11:59 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Allies were useless
11:59 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: If you put limitations on it, tpa is fine
11:59 AM - Delay: how about that waypoint plugin I threw in my shitbuild?
12:00 PM - Delay: the one that claimed it copied runecraft for it
12:00 PM - Flinch: the waypoint system was good
12:00 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: fun as fuck guessing them
12:00 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But they had an issue
12:00 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Where you could teleport through 12 block thick walls
12:00 PM - Delay: security?
12:01 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: so yeah
12:01 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: :^)
12:01 PM - Delay: wait, what now?
12:01 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: If you put one sideways against a wall
12:01 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You could teleport through that wall
12:01 PM - Delay: are you talking about runecraft's waypoints or the plugin I used?
12:02 PM - Delay: I found a plugin that claimed to work like runecraft's waypoints
12:02 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: RC
12:02 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I assume yours is the same
12:02 PM - StruttingB4 disconnected.
12:02 PM - Delay: there was no mention of that being possible
12:02 PM - Delay: in the plugin page
12:02 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >like they'd admit to a flaw that big
12:03 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: top
12:03 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: bun
12:03 PM - Mawr: it isnt the same monkeys
12:03 PM - Mawr: doesnt tp you through anything
12:03 PM - Delay: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/teleportationrunes/
12:03 PM - Mawr: you just fail to tp if the area in the center of the waypoint is obstructed in any way
12:05 PM - Delay: would that make up for the lack of tpa?
12:05 PM - Delay: is it restricted enough as well?
12:05 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: memes
12:05 PM - Mawr: I liked runecraft better :^)
12:05 PM - Delay: the exp cost is optional
12:05 PM - Mawr: Better discuss the armor weight
12:06 PM - Delay: Not much to discuss without field testing

12:06 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Don't nerf move rates
12:06 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: nerf weapon swing rate
12:06 PM - Delay: I was thinking about restricting inventories as well to be an asshole
12:06 PM - Delay: that's a thing
12:06 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Making people slow is just shitty
12:07 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Making a choice between attack and defense isn't
12:07 PM - Delay: I can make them FAST too :^)
12:08 PM - Delay: I doubt you can edit the swing rate without mods though
12:08 PM - Mawr: >restricting inventories
12:08 PM - Mawr: too far
12:08 PM - Delay: I mean reduce it
12:08 PM - Delay: how about reducing max item stacks
12:08 PM - Mawr: still bad ;^
12:08 PM - Mawr: um
12:08 PM - D.J - Fred: why would you do that
12:08 PM - Mawr: for what purpose
12:09 PM - Delay: to give everyone a harder time
12:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Delay you fucking idiot
12:09 PM - Mawr: I like my ebin idea of disabling the End
12:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You don't make grinding more difficult
12:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Why do you hate Endstone Mawr?
12:09 PM - Mawr: lel
12:09 PM - Gakthoil: Disable the End, else it's getting scamped
12:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 45 TNT resist make you shiver?
12:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: :^)
12:09 PM - Delay: maybe force people to use mules and minecarts
12:09 PM - Mawr: :^)
12:10 PM - Dante: Remember when
12:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: aw shit
12:10 PM - Dante: people wanted spies to get banned and the factions they are from
12:10 PM - Mawr: no end -> cant farm pearls -> buff to castles / overground structures
12:10 PM - Dante: My sides
12:10 PM - Dante: they were non-existant at that time
12:10 PM - Mawr: pls no bully
12:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Now I'll have to remake my railway player traps
12:10 PM - Mawr: actually its a buff to everything defensive most likely
12:10 PM - Mawr: but especially walls
12:10 PM - Mawr: >muh walls
12:10 PM - Archevei: >endstone
12:10 PM - Archevei: FUCK
12:10 PM - Archevei: ENDSTONE
12:10 PM - Dante: >defensive
12:10 PM - Archevei: DJINRA
12:11 PM - Delay: rave knows what to say to make me wet
12:11 PM - Dante: wait do you want to make defense a better part in the game
12:11 PM - Mawr: >I'll just put some bedrock here, cause why not
12:11 PM - Mawr: le djinra faec
12:11 PM - Dante: because IMO,raiding is the best part 4craft has
12:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Defense from pearls
12:11 PM - Dante: the factor that makes it playable
12:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You can pretty much fire pearls through anything
12:11 PM - Dante: so if anyone wants to fix the server
12:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's really sad
12:11 PM - Dante: focus on offense
12:11 PM - Dante: im not saying that you should strip every god damn protection
12:11 PM - D.J - Fred: raiding is fun
12:12 PM - Dante: But make it more fun
12:12 PM - Delay: if offense is too easy, it's not very fun
12:12 PM - Mawr: One idea would be to make it easier to get prot iv :^)
12:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Just figure out hybrid cannons
12:12 PM - Mawr: >obligatory https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzKd-DJ_Jg0LofEGVxH_IGtKvEtFDTLrCG02Eygf3aY/edit

12:16 PM - Delay: and traps
12:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We always build a comfy fort dude
12:16 PM - Delay: traps are the best part of tg
12:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Except in v6 where we had a comfy design
12:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But never finished it

12:30 PM - Dante: >velo (leader of 4cis) said it will take 8 hours to build the base
12:30 PM - Dante: >it took two
12:30 PM - Dante: Two days*
12:30 PM - Delay: simpleFactions - http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/simple-factions/pages/commands/ The defualt chat channel is global. Use /f c to pick a channel, I recommend playing with local chat.
TeleportationRunes - http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/teleportationrunes/
GriefLog - [/glog tool] Use the item on a block to see a log of who destroyed or placed a block on that spot in the past. The log file gets purged every two days. 
Creepers will not destroy blocks, increased TnT will make up for it. 

Most values are configurable and open to change. 

ArmorWeight - Makes you walk slower the higher the tier of armor you're wearing. 
CraftManipulation - Lets you recieve more of an item when crafted. Used for TnT(3), Rails(4), and Fire Charges(24). 
EnchantLimiter - Limits enchants (needs testing). Affected enchants are the following: I Fire Aspect, I Punch, I Knockback, II Thorns, II Power, II Protection, III Sharpness, III Projectile Protection. 
NoNpcTrade - Disables villager trading. Unless somebody gives me a legit way to rebalance villager trading it's gonna stay this way. I spent way too much time trying to find a plugin that just worked, I don't even like the whole trade system. If you want shit, craft it. 
ObsidianDestroyer - Obsidian and Enchant tables take 3 blasts to destroy. There's an interesting rebalancing possibility with how it's possible to have different blocks have higher blast resistance but I won't touch that for now.
12:30 PM - D.J - Fred: kek
12:30 PM - D.J - Fred: 2 days of mining obsidian on /ck/

12:36 PM - Dante: how many dicks can you put in your mouth
12:36 PM - Mawr: It's only gay if it's a man's penis in my opinion. If the penis is attached to a girl it's hot, but if it's a man's penis then I couldn't give a shit
12:36 PM - Dante: That
12:36 PM - Dante: thats hot
12:36 PM - Mawr: I mean, as long as you're not getting assfucked, it isn't totally gay right?

12:47 AM - StruttingB4: lately I've been thinking a lot about autism
12:48 AM - Flinch: go on
12:56 AM - StruttingB4: I've been thinking a lot about autism lately.

You know regardless of how this particular thing works itself out, I will be autistic, and so will you. And so will everyone here.

And that's what I wanna explore.

We're all hurtling towards total inability to socially interact, yet here we are for the moment communicating with eachother. Each of us knowing we're reach that point. Each of us secretly believing we won't.
12:57 AM - Delay: I wish I had autism
12:57 AM - Delay: for autismbux
12:58 AM - StruttingB4: You're wish has already been granted
12:58 AM - StruttingB4: it was granted a long time ago, years possibly
12:59 AM - Delay: I was legit tested for autism
12:59 AM - Delay: and I failed
12:59 AM - StruttingB4: the moment you accepted the age agreement on the front page of 4chan
12:59 AM - Delay: well, I went to get myself tested
12:59 AM - StruttingB4: that was the moment you sealed your fate
1:00 AM - StruttingB4: does anyone have the copypastas I wrote a few days ago
1:00 AM - Delay: turned out I may or may not have more complicated brain problems than autism
1:00 AM - Delay: was told to go to a legit psychologist

1:11 AM - Delay: Panty & Stocking is fun
1:11 AM - StruttingB4: found it
1:11 AM - StruttingB4: If you're morally ok with thor fucking it up like he always does, you're a degenerate; If you don't believe that it's happening right now, you're slow; If you don't care, or if you pretend not to care because your dipshit kounter-kulture friends made you socially afraid of honest expression, the the enemy has succeeded in making it all look like a pile of meaningless and impossible-to-untangle abstractions that don't affect you.

3:56 AM - Delay: "Whilst the big news for today is obviously the 1.8 release, I would..."
3:57 AM - Delay: Today I am proud to announce the immediate availability of Bukkit, CraftBukkit, Spigot-API and Spigot server, all updated and ready for use with Minecraft 1.8! The decision to perform this update ourselves was one made early October, about 7 weeks ago and a goal which we have been working tirelessly towards ever since. Obviously things are going to be a little bit different than in the past, but hopefully they won’t be any more complicated (we have tried our best to make it as simple as possible, but fixes and improvements are welcome).
3:59 AM - Delay: post is basically "1.8 server out! here's a history dump to make the post bigger."
4:00 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's actually been 1.8 for awhile
4:00 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Like 3 months

4:34 AM - Delay: on the surface at least
4:34 AM - Delay: I don't know about any possible errors that have to be triggered
4:35 AM - Delay: also nocheat+ works normally aside from not knowing what to do about the new blocks
4:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: NCP should be able to work with new blocks
4:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Well, if you add rules in for it or some shit
4:37 AM - Delay: yeah
4:37 AM - Delay: so that's no problem
4:37 AM - Delay: the only real problem is essentials
4:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Ess usually updates quick
4:40 AM - Delay: oh, also anti aura
4:40 AM - Delay: should be remedied soon enough though

12:12 PM - Delay: In the beginning, the player can go with four basic job classes. During class advancement, each basic job classes can branch out into 19 job classes. This is how we get 80 job classes, a lot for players to choose from, even some classes can hardly be found in other games. In the future, we are planning to add in more class advancements (second stage, third stage).
12:13 PM - Delay: oh baby
12:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: whar
12:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: what
12:13 PM - Delay: All the skills in each job classes are different. For example, Chronomancer from the Wizard class, an Chronomancer can fast forward time, go back to the past and time stop. No other job classes has such skills. Job names are distinguished by skills; there are many job classes that have Eastern culture and elements.

12:21 PM - Delay: no no
12:21 PM - Delay: it's not quite like that
12:22 PM - Delay: 17173:
You talked about instances earlier. In Ragnarok Online, PVE and boss fights are all in the fields. Will Tree of Savior be any different?

Kim Seyong:
The instances in Tree of Savior are also in the fields. We are open world. The instances are unlike traditional MMORPG where it is a closed and separated. Players can go fight the boss alone or party up to five members to fight boss together.

Because of the open world design, one boss raids can support up to 200 players at once. Each party can only have maximum of five members. Even though you cannot party with the rest of 195 players, but there will be some kind of interaction between players.

5:31 AM - Dante: As in
5:32 AM - Delay: maybe throw in some helpful feature
5:32 AM - Dante: Oh
5:32 AM - Delay: makes sure players can't claim in your "territory" maybe
5:32 AM - Dante: just so that you can get text that someone entered your teritory
5:32 AM - Dante: Yeah
5:32 AM - Delay: maybe just for enemies
5:32 AM - Delay: if at all
5:33 AM - Delay: so factions can legitimately say they "own" this area
5:33 AM - Delay: despite not having protections for it
5:33 AM - Delay: hell, we can make it so claims don't have to be next to each other inside "territories"
5:34 AM - Delay: *protection claims

6:02 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: More nodes you claim
6:02 AM - Delay: though I was thinking of how the territories would be decided for factions
6:02 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: The more your territory grows
6:02 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Though the territory is semi-protected
6:02 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I figure have basically "bubbles" around the nodes
6:03 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And make blocks harder to break in enemy territory
6:05 AM - Delay: Sounds interesting but I can't quite see it in my head
6:05 AM - Delay: and from what I understand of it, I can't really get behind using it for 4craft
6:06 AM - Pip: so a node would be an item dispenser?
6:06 AM - Tomato disconnected.
6:06 AM - Delay: sounds like it
6:06 AM - Dante: the fug is a node
6:06 AM - Delay: like a civcraft factory I guess
6:06 AM - Delay: but maybe only for resources?
6:09 AM - Delay: I have an idea for the territory thing that works in a similar way I guess
6:09 AM - Delay: but without resource nodes
6:09 AM - Delay: you know how there's the invisible chunk grid?
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: well basically you'd remove all ore, mining, farming, etc
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: and leave it to the nodes
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So yeah, item dispenser
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: that also gives territory control and protection
6:10 AM - Delay: this kills the gameplay
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Removes the "playercount" aspect
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: What it removes the grind?
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kek
6:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So instead of mining, you're building forts to protect nodes
6:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Building is funner than mining m8
6:11 AM - Pip: how to take diamond node from /a/ if all you have is wood armor
6:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Get a diamond node
6:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Disconnected node claims break, etc
6:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No enclave/exclave
6:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Besides, while you're hitting their diamond node
6:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Some other chucklefucks can go hit their melon node and take out their HP pots
6:12 AM - Dante: >building is funner than mining
6:12 AM - Dante: >he wants to make /tg/ even stronger
6:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kek
6:12 AM - Dante: fug of
6:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kek
6:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I want to make it more fun
6:12 AM - Dante: For you
6:13 AM - Delay: what was that buzzword the AAA devs use nowadays?
6:13 AM - Dante: I know your schemes goy
6:13 AM - Pip: uhh you dont get to bring fun
6:13 AM - Delay: where they make everything simple as shit
6:13 AM - Dante: casual ?
6:13 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Sure you could call it a casualization of MC
6:13 AM - Delay: to reach a wider audience
6:13 AM - Delay: no
6:13 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Streamline
6:13 AM - Delay: streamlining the experience I think
6:13 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
6:13 AM - Delay: yeah
6:13 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That'd be if I started removing blocks
6:13 AM - Delay: no
6:14 AM - Delay: that'd be if you removed resource gathering
6:14 AM - Delay: oh wait
6:14 AM - Delay: :^)
6:14 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You think territory control will be more casual than faction claiming?
6:14 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: k
6:14 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: e
6:14 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: k
6:14 AM - Pip: how many nodes would there be?
6:14 AM - Delay: there are other ways to manage territory control
6:14 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I haven't even begun coding it
6:14 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I just got a few design docs
6:14 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Might not even make it
6:15 AM - Delay: yours just removes a gameplay element at the same time and you try to sell it as innovative
6:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You like MMO's where you have to get 15 boars, don't you
6:15 AM - Pip: i do
6:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Mining in MC is just another fetch quest
6:15 AM - Pip: i like the nodes idea though
6:15 AM - Delay: no, I like the ones where I party up with people and we go kill 20 mobs at once then rinse repeat
6:16 AM - Pip: it would be fun having a monopoly over some resource
6:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: nah I wouldn't allow that
6:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: + probably make some nodes neutral
6:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Like diamond node can't be claimed or some shit
6:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: To encourage fighting
6:16 AM - Delay: the idea of nodes is interesting but I hate the automation of it
6:17 AM - Delay: "wait here for free shit"
6:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's not like the resources end up in your bases box
6:17 AM - Delay: "you are winner"
6:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You gobba transport them
6:17 AM - Pip: people will build base over the good nodes
6:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I figure just give everyone infinite rails and let them work it out
6:17 AM - Dante: Dont do this
6:17 AM - Delay: well then you gotta get rid of f home
6:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Nah, fixed "spawn" node
6:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: dude
6:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
6:17 AM - Delay: then there's also the protections to deal with
6:17 AM - Dante: This is obviously going to buff /tg/ since they are literally going to go dwarf mode if this happens
6:18 AM - Dante: lag machines everywhere
6:18 AM - Dante: no one on the surface
6:18 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: lel
6:18 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I want to make the underground tiny
6:18 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Like Sea Level at Y-24 tiny
6:18 AM - Dante: ''We stalker nao''
6:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Delay wants surface bases
6:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He'll get it
6:19 AM - Delay: not like this
6:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No reason to have an underground if theres no mining
6:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: :^)
6:19 AM - Delay: literally nothing to do but "grind" resources
6:19 AM - Delay: just in a less fun way
6:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No, it's "alright stones in, lets go build"
6:20 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It shifts more player time from resource shit
6:20 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: To buildin n fightin
6:22 AM - Delay: times like these that I wish I was smarter
6:22 AM - Delay: so I could tell you why I disagree with that philosophy
6:22 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Lets take a vote
6:22 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Who thinks Mining is boring
6:22 AM - Delay: no shit, mining is boring
6:23 AM - Delay: but it's not so boring to make it not worth doing
6:23 AM - Delay: people mine, then they build shit out of what they mined
6:24 AM - Dante: We can make votes ?
6:24 AM - Delay: it's the effort put into what you make that makes it much more satisfying
6:24 AM - Dante: I VOTE TO REMOVE MONGOL
6:24 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And here the effort is defending it
6:24 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: rather than fucking grinding
6:25 AM - Delay: as if anyone's going to try to take over a fucking stone supplier
6:27 AM - Delay: and the longer you wait, the larger their stores of reserves get
6:27 AM - Delay: eventually, everyone's gonna be swimming in wealth
6:28 AM - Delay: and the only action that goes on is the usual base sieging because that's the only place that fucking matters
6:29 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats why the expensive shit is going to be rare enough that'll be a month before everyone can be kitted in Diamond
6:29 AM - Delay: and you bitch to me about grinding
6:32 AM - Delay: oh yeah
6:32 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No, this is making a rarity a rarity
6:32 AM - Delay: it's basically large scale settlers of catan, isn't it?
6:32 AM - Dante: >not just somehow making raiding a bigger part of the game
6:32 AM - Delay: not that I've played that
6:32 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats what this is
6:32 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Capture nodes, get more resources
6:32 AM - Delay: https://www.google.no/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=settlers+of+catan+minecraft
6:32 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Kill a faction, you get their territory
6:33 AM - Delay: make a few modifications here and there and there's what you want
6:33 AM - Dante: Then get rid of island and make it a continent
6:33 AM - Dante: and make bases more breachable
6:33 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: lel
6:33 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats what this will do in the end
6:33 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: If a faction has no nodes
6:33 AM - Dante: Wat
6:34 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You can break blocks
6:34 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So you talk about central base raiding rather than node raiding Delay?
6:34 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats my counter
6:34 AM - Dante: Wait so basicly from what i understood from reading a little
6:34 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Grind down the nodes
6:34 AM - Dante: A node is a teritory
6:34 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
6:34 AM - Dante: that gets controlled by a faction
6:34 AM - Dante: and controlling it gives you a certain recourse
6:34 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Yeah, and a faction has a central one
6:34 AM - Dante: But
6:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Central one doesn't count for protection
6:35 AM - Dante: Is it special to have a node because only YOUR faction can mine it ?
6:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: what
6:35 AM - Delay: you don't mine at nodes
6:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No you don't
6:35 AM - Delay: you just get free shit
6:35 AM - Dante: What do you do
6:35 AM - Delay: over time
6:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeha
6:35 AM - Dante: Are nodes protected or something ?
6:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Defend it, get shit
6:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Yeah
6:35 AM - Dante: So you can't break the blocks in it ?
6:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But the claims are much smaller than your central claim
6:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So cannons will work better
6:36 AM - Dante: How do you control it ?
6:36 AM - Dante: If it is capturing a point
6:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I figure you just gotta sit there with some people for a bit, or some other mechanism
6:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Haven't figured that bit out
6:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Like at the node physically
6:36 AM - Delay: that shouldn't be an issue
6:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Or you have to feed it something to capture it
6:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: IE right click with the magic stick
6:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: or some shit
6:37 AM - Dante: lel
6:37 AM - Dante: if it'd be possible
6:37 AM - Dante: i'd just make it that you need to capture it like you capture points in games
6:37 AM - Delay: the concept is sound
6:37 AM - Delay: but it's not minecraft
6:37 AM - Dante: by getting at one point which needs to be protected,get some guys and start capping it
6:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Yep
6:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Not Minecraft
6:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Gonna be fun as fuck though
6:38 AM - Dante: A grid like system would be fun though
6:38 AM - Dante: as in Civilization games
6:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I'd call it Warcraft, but Bliz beat me to it
6:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
6:38 AM - Dante: >there will never EVER be a warcraft 4
6:38 AM - Dante: god dammit blizzard
6:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 5:53 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >tfw thats what node would allow
5:53 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >tfw I wanted to somehow map what factions controlled what nodes onto the map externally
5:54 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >tfw I wanted it to turn into GSG
6:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So have some sort of dynmap
6:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: With territories controled n shit
6:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: To give an overview
6:38 AM - Dante: But again
6:39 AM - Dante: as people said
6:39 AM - Dante: its starting in december
6:39 AM - Delay: it'll heavily enforce combat and warring which might be cool
6:39 AM - Dante: if it is even going to start
6:39 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >imblying it's planned for v7
6:39 AM - Delay: we're just throwing ideas around
6:39 AM - Dante: this should be planned months earlier
6:39 AM - Delay: dante
6:39 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >emblying I'll even mek it
6:39 AM - Dante: Delay
6:39 AM - Delay: it's just ideas
6:39 AM - Dante: what world type did you use for your map
6:39 AM - Delay: mite b cool
6:39 AM - Dante: Amplified ?
6:39 AM - Delay: no
6:39 AM - Delay: it's custom
6:39 AM - Delay: http://imgur.com/a/nw2UN#DVZi0TM
6:41 AM - Delay: your idea, monkeys
6:41 AM - Tomato entered chat.
6:41 AM - Delay: it's nice but not minecraft
6:42 AM - Delay: you might as well call it a different gamemode
6:42 AM - Delay: like hungergames or something
6:43 AM - Delay: removes like half of what you do in minecraft and emphasizes faction warring
6:43 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (and trading)
6:44 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (and alliances)
6:44 AM - Dante: >hunger games
6:44 AM - Delay: It's probably ideal for a weekly reset kind of thing
6:44 AM - Dante: worst example ever
6:44 AM - Delay: jesus, dante
6:45 AM - Delay: I meant how it's so far away from the point of vanilla mc
6:45 AM - Delay: and it's not necessarily a bad thing
6:45 AM - Delay: there are other gamemodes to compare it to
6:45 AM - Delay: but I never cared for that shit
6:46 AM - Delay: you're also gonna need a dedicated playerbase for something like that
6:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >weekly reset
6:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: jesus no
6:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I want this thing to evolve so there are cities
6:47 AM - Dante: does anyone have a v6 save ?
6:47 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Ideally there would be enough unclaimed node land to allow factions to rebuild
6:47 AM - Dante: i'd want to try somethign out
6:47 AM - Pip: so you want 4craft to last more than 2 weeks?
6:47 AM - Pip: inderdasting
6:47 AM - Delay: everyone wants that
6:48 AM - Delay: it's not like 4craft was ever built around the fact that it usually only lasts a week
6:48 AM - Dante: So basicly from what i think
6:48 AM - Dante: a good way to counter an underwater obsidian base is to just make a block on the top of the ocean,pour lava on it and just start making a giant sheat of cobblestone above it
6:49 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: so
6:49 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: what if there are multiple layers of water
6:49 AM - Tomato disconnected.
6:50 AM - Delay: no, best way is to claim all around that shit base
6:50 AM - Dante: What do you mean multiple layers of it
6:50 AM - Delay: and never allow them to leave
6:50 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: multiple water layers
6:53 AM - Delay: civ iv was square based, wasn't it?
6:53 AM - Dante: So basicly you want this https://ab404266b8e6ebfd9e4c-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/MG5QKR7rgrzQ.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg
6:53 AM - Dante: ?
6:54 AM - Delay: civ iv is more fitting
6:54 AM - Delay: since it's square based
7:05 AM - Dante: Yeah
7:05 AM - Dante: Hexagons would't really be a better option for mincraft
7:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: but yeah
7:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Idea was minimal protected "territory"
7:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: semiprotected "node" bit
7:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: and heavily protected "core" node
7:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I figure don't even allow the core node to be raided unless an adjacent node is compromised
7:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: To allow creative building

12:18 PM - Archevei: the jews did this
12:18 PM - Delay: then how about this
12:18 PM - D.J - Fred:  http://cdn.steamcommunity.com/economy/emoticon/misterx 
12:19 PM - Dante: But you added the 2nd L
12:19 PM - Dante: faggot
12:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: AALLLYY?
12:19 PM - Delay: we raise blast resist of stoney blocks
12:19 PM - Delay: and we turn off the water thing
12:19 PM - Dante: YES
12:19 PM - Dante: AALLLY
12:19 PM - Dante: >american education
12:19 PM - Delay: might as well raise blast resist of everything while we're at it
12:19 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: yes
12:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Honestly blast resist doesn't matter that much
12:19 PM - Delay: tnt is also x3 per craft
12:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Dude
12:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Dude.
12:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: fug
12:20 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Has the version been decided yet?
12:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 1.8
12:20 PM - Bob the Biscuit: RIP
12:20 PM - Bob the Biscuit: ded on arrival
12:20 PM - Dante: >Being this ignorant
12:20 PM - Dante: >time to ban
12:20 PM - Delay: just to balance out the fact that there's no more poor man's anti-tnt
12:20 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: alterantely just make only water source blocks block tnt, but make tnt destroy only water source blocks if it explodes in water
12:20 PM - Dante: I volunter
12:20 PM - Delay: btw
12:21 PM - D.J - Fred: remove scamps, remove underwater bases, remove underground bases, remove sky bases, remove treehouse bases and remove autism cube bases
12:21 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: remove bob
12:21 PM - Delay: coty fixed the slime block thing
12:21 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: bob worst admin
12:21 PM - Bob the Biscuit: confirmed
12:21 PM - Delay: a while ago
12:21 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: ebin
12:21 PM - Bob the Biscuit: I am the cancer that is killing 4craft
12:21 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: delay whatever happened to the stuff you were giving coty autismbux for
12:21 PM - Delay: that's too complicated, patchy
12:21 PM - Delay: it's simplefactions
12:22 PM - Dante: >no option to kick people from chat
12:22 PM - Dante: disgusting
12:22 PM - Delay: no citadel-like block break prot though
12:22 PM - Delay: but other than that, it's good
12:22 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: block reinforcement is like the holy grail :(
12:22 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: w/e good enuf I guess
12:22 PM - Delay: there's a seperate plugin that can be used for that
12:23 PM - Delay: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/reinforcedblocks/
12:23 PM - Delay: but I prefer everything be reinforced by default if it's in faction territory
12:23 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: that was the idea
12:24 PM - Delay: you could throw money at coty yourself to get him to do it
12:24 PM - Delay: for v7
12:24 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: v8&
12:24 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: v8*
12:24 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: 2hard
12:24 PM - Delay: I have no money and I'm content with what we already have
12:25 PM - Delay: well, not enough to pay for that
12:25 PM - Delay: unless it just literally takes him an hour
12:25 PM - Bob the Biscuit: You need to buy 4craft gold for that
12:26 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: unlike janitors, coty doesn't do it 4 free
12:26 PM - Delay: sometimes he does
12:26 PM - Delay: like the beacon thing
12:27 PM - Mawr: hmm auto block reinforcement in faction territory would make underground bases extremely op wouldnt it
12:28 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: I guess, you could always just go in through their front door
12:28 PM - Delay: :^)
12:28 PM - Coty: automatically reinforcing all blocks that are in faction land instead of 100% protecting them I could do in probably an hour or two
12:28 PM - Coty: but if you wanted to "upgrade" individual blocks to reinforce them; that one would probably take me all day tbh
12:28 PM - Mawr: not if the frot door is a drop
12:28 PM - Delay: how about making the reinforcement levels variable?
12:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: also I think it was only meant to be placed blocks
12:29 PM - Mawr: mite work with no /f home tho
12:29 PM - Mawr: ah
12:29 PM - GriffinWing: Upgrading blocks to be reinforced sounds pretty swank
12:29 PM - Dante: So basicly
12:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: or at least not dirt/gravel/cobble
12:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: uh
12:29 PM - Coty: I could DO it but it would take me forever
12:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: dirt/gravel/smoothstone
12:29 PM - Dante: we need to make coty a 4chan janitor
12:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: cobble is ok
12:29 PM - Mawr: yeah just dont reinforce stone
12:29 PM - Delay: if it's upgrading block then there's this http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/reinforcedblocks/
12:29 PM - Dante: and then he does it for free ?
12:29 PM - Mawr: yaya what patchu said
12:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: that way building a base underground doesn't confer you any special benefits in terms of block reinforcement
12:30 PM - Mawr: upgrading blocks 1 by 1 is annoying
12:30 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: i imagine you could do a stack of them with that plugin
12:30 PM - Delay: just autoreinforce stone brick or something
12:30 PM - Delay: bam
12:30 PM - Coty: if I were to do it
12:30 PM - Coty: it'd be something like
12:30 PM - Coty: >place block
12:30 PM - Mawr: still annoying to place them manually
12:30 PM - Coty: >right click block with diamond
12:30 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: thats how citadel does it
12:30 PM - Coty: >block is now 1.25x stronger and it consumes the diamond
12:30 PM - Mawr: autoreinforcing all blocks except for stone/gravel/dirt is best
12:30 PM - Delay: literally citadel, isn't it?
12:30 PM - Coty: never used citadel
12:31 PM - Coty: I think I fixed a bug in it once but literally never used it lmao
12:31 PM - Delay: I agree with rave
12:31 PM - Mawr: after a delay actually
12:31 PM - Mawr: 10 mins maybe
12:31 PM - Mawr: so no spamming blocks while being raided
12:31 PM - Delay: well, not even every block
12:31 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: >starting a timer for every block placed
12:31 PM - Mawr: yeah, thats just details though
12:32 PM - Coty: but yeah, I could do all that but I wouldn't do that for free :3c - like I said it would literally take all day and I don't have time for that atm
12:32 PM - GriffinWing: Coty is cute
12:32 PM - Delay: really, even just autoreinforcing stone brick and obsidian should be enough
12:32 PM - Coty: the automatically reinforcing all claimed blocks I could do though
12:33 PM - Mawr: gud enough if you can specify blocks to exclude
12:33 PM - Mawr: which should be easy i'd imagine
12:33 PM - Delay: how long would it take to program it so you can specify the reinforcement value of particular blocks?
12:33 PM - Coty: a bit longer
12:33 PM - Coty: like another hour probably
12:34 PM - Coty: I'd have to type up lots of junk
12:34 PM - Delay: how about what rave said?
12:34 PM - Coty: you mean mawr?
12:34 PM - Delay: yeah
12:34 PM - Coty: that would be pretty quick
12:34 PM - Archevei: >THE GEORGIA BULLDOGS
12:34 PM - Archevei: GET FUCKING REKT
12:34 PM - Delay: he will always be rave in my heart
12:34 PM - Mawr: ayy who is rave
12:34 PM - Mawr: :^)
12:34 PM - Coty: I don't keep up with name changes
12:34 PM - Delay: one more thing, we'll be able to specify the degree of reinforcement, right?
12:35 PM - Coty: taking a little ramen break right now
12:35 PM - Coty: yeah
12:35 PM - Coty: I'm trying to integrate essentials support into factions
12:35 PM - Coty: so I can get nicknames and homes and shit
12:35 PM - Delay: but
12:35 PM - Delay: why not just leave that to essentials?
12:36 PM - Coty: right now its just so I can display the nickname in chat
12:36 PM - Delay: shit like groupmanager needs essentials to work as well
12:36 PM - Coty: instead of always showign the player's real name
12:36 PM - Delay: man, fuck nicknames
12:36 PM - Coty: simplefactions is currently kidn of a dick when it comes to the chat
12:36 PM - Archevei: >ramen
12:36 PM - Coty: it 100% takes it over
12:36 PM - Archevei: how does it feel to be a poor college student
12:36 PM - Archevei: living in stillwater

12:47 PM - Mawr: the array fetch or whatever
12:48 PM - Coty: oh
12:48 PM - Coty: yeah you're right
12:48 PM - Coty: that's bad, something I overlooked
12:48 PM - Coty: not really a big deal though
12:48 PM - Mawr: by making that into a variable you optimize and make the code better by actually naming the thing
12:48 PM - Coty: it only happens when commands are passed

12:49 PM - Coty: there's lots of little areas for improvement like that all over the plugin
12:49 PM - Delay: fix it
12:49 PM - Dante: just kidding bby
12:49 PM - Dante: coty would never help a faction
12:49 PM - Delay: muh optimizimatations

12:54 PM - shea550: soo is it possible to have autism cubes banned?
12:54 PM - Flinch: git gud /k/
12:54 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: This is why you claim near your base kiddies http://i.imgur.com/q0kCxLz.png
12:54 PM - Mawr: better to discourage them by design
12:54 PM - shea550: fuck off /tg/
12:54 PM - Delay: nothing confirmed yet aside from simplefactions replacing regular factions
12:54 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: lel
12:54 PM - shea550: your all meta powergamers who love dnd
12:54 PM - Coty: autism cubes are easier to raid with 3d claiming I think
12:55 PM - shea550: easier
12:55 PM - shea550: but still annoying
12:55 PM - shea550: id like to see actual buildings

12:55 PM - Coty: it COULD be done
12:55 PM - shea550: wouldnt it be easier
12:56 PM - shea550: to just fly arround to each base
12:56 PM - shea550: and say this is okay and wont fall
12:56 PM - Mawr: ayy lmao coty
12:56 PM - shea550: or nah this falls to shit
12:56 PM - Delay: kek
12:56 PM - Dante: yeah
12:56 PM - D.J - Fred: /k/ is an irrelevant faction with an even more irrelevant leader
12:56 PM - Mawr: use either tabs or spaces nigger
12:56 PM - Dante: people would really like
12:56 PM - Dante: to do that
12:56 PM - Delay: sure but it can't be guaranteed to be fair
12:56 PM - Dante: /k/ should just quit
12:56 PM - shea550: no u
12:56 PM - Mawr: not both
12:56 PM - Coty: so saile what have you been up to these days?
12:56 PM - shea550: anyways so if i make a petition and a bunch of people sign it can we ban autism bases?
12:57 PM - Dante: Fuck
12:57 PM - Dante: off
12:57 PM - Mawr: not a good question m8
12:57 PM - Dante: casual
12:57 PM - Flinch: if petitions worked /a/ would be banned
12:57 PM - Dante: kill yourself
12:57 PM - shea550: hell yeah they would
12:57 PM - Dante: what flinch said
12:57 PM - Coty: I did ban jammku that one time a ton of people asked
12:57 PM - shea550: lel
12:57 PM - Delay: but that was justified
12:57 PM - shea550: yeah so what if like everyone but /a/ wants autism cubes banned
12:57 PM - shea550: why wouldnt you ban them?
12:58 PM - Delay: the problem is policing it
12:58 PM - Mawr: define an autism cube pls
12:58 PM - shea550: you sound like a bunch of weeaboo lovers to me...
12:58 PM - Dante: Because /a/ funds coty
12:58 PM - shea550: litterly
12:58 PM - Dante: Alright
12:58 PM - Dante: Numbers in names
12:58 PM - Delay: you can't just ban something and have no automated way to police it in a videogame
12:58 PM - Dante: check
12:58 PM - Coty: >policing
12:58 PM - Dante: uses three dots
12:58 PM - Dante: check

12:58 PM - Coty: you know it'd be fun
12:58 PM - Dante: can't type literally

12:58 PM - Delay: it would
12:58 PM - shea550: no u
12:58 PM - Dante: Faggotness
12:58 PM - Dante: check
12:58 PM - Mawr: stop mixing tabs and spaces in your source code coty
12:58 PM - shea550: NO u
12:58 PM - shea550: so yeah
12:58 PM - Coty: you can't stop me mawr
12:58 PM - Dante: is in a shit faction
12:58 PM - Dante: check
12:59 PM - Mawr: muh autism
12:59 PM - shea550: no need to define autism cubes,
12:59 PM - Coty: my tabs ARE spaces
12:59 PM - shea550: just police them
12:59 PM - Coty: unless github breaks it
12:59 PM - shea550: there will only be like some 20 factions
12:59 PM - Dante: >only
12:59 PM - Mawr: fucking implying

12:59 PM - Dante: >ONLY
12:59 PM - Coty: haha
12:59 PM - shea550: yeah dante
12:59 PM - Delay: how long would it take to program in some simple structural integrity shit?
12:59 PM - shea550: hardly any boards play

1:00 PM - Coty: I have no idea how I'd actually go about it
1:00 PM - Dante: >wanting ez modo
1:00 PM - Coty: but like
1:00 PM - Coty: probably a day
1:00 PM - Coty: or maybe a few hours
1:00 PM - Mawr: there are automated tools for that breddy sure
1:00 PM - D.J - Fred: http://strawpoll.me/1532417
1:00 PM - Dante: I remember
1:00 PM - D.J - Fred: remember this shea
1:00 PM - Dante: when people wanted spies banned,and the faction they are from too
1:00 PM - Coty: honestly like twenty minutes of programming a a whole day of debugging

1:03 PM - D.J - Fred: rip sky bases
1:03 PM - Delay: but structural integrity would also shit on strangely generated terrain, wouldn't it?
1:03 PM - Coty: nah
1:03 PM - Coty: I would only do checks for when building/destroying is done

1:04 PM - Coty: make obsidian float
1:04 PM - Coty: so everything has to rest on it
1:04 PM - Coty: the original concept in minecraft actually
1:04 PM - Dante: >make autism base

1:06 PM - Dante: fug of bobo
1:07 PM - Delay: doesn't have to fall correctly
1:07 PM - Delay: just chaotically collapse
1:07 PM - Bob the Biscuit: But wouldnt a sort of diamond skeleton throughout the entire base be better than just the bottom?

changelog
* fixed typo in /sf f
* rounded the numbers for the home in /sf f
* added support for nicknames
* you can now disable claims and sethomes in specific worlds
* slime blocks being moved by pistons across faction land can now be
disabled in the config (to prevent missiles and moving castles)
* fixed the config file to be in order at all times, and update properly
* config file is now 100% easier to read and understand
* fixed bug that made all world names "world" in simplefactions (only
affected claims)
* fixed a bug making it only possible to claim one chunk at a time (was
a 1.8 bug, fixed now)
* added /sf autounclaim
* fixed a bug that didn't load the correct configs, in 1.8
* made config.json work on the fly* ish. It's accessed to often to
always be ready on the fly, like the rest of the plugin; but certain
conditions will trigger it to be reloaded so you won't need a full
server restart to change config stuff.
* made autoclaim say "enabled/disabled" instead of "toggled"
* you can now "shout" (speak in global chat) from any other chat by
prefixing your message with a !. example: !message

3:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: yeah that was caused by a code change in spigot
3:29 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: changing how damage modifiers worked
3:30 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: but basically the higher your damage, the more your damage got reduced by armor
3:30 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: so lots of armor + high damage = you are healing them

5:19 PM - StruttingB4: seriously
5:19 PM - Flinch: we need the slime blocks to change the meta
5:19 PM - StruttingB4: 1.7.2 clients can connect to 1.7.10
5:20 PM - StruttingB4: slime blocks are unbalanced
5:20 PM - Delay: why can't you play 1.8?
5:20 PM - StruttingB4: becauase I get constant lag after playing for 2 minutes
5:20 PM - Delay: >implying the imbalance just got patched
5:21 PM - Delay: wait
5:21 PM - Delay: >implying the slime imbalance didn't just get patched in sf
5:21 PM - StruttingB4: what
5:21 PM - Flinch: why would you do that, now there is still no way to breach autism forts
5:22 PM - Coty: I actually made it a config in sf
5:23 PM - Coty: to stop slime things from going over faction lines
5:23 PM - Coty: its not confirmed whether or not that'll be set to true in 4craft
5:23 PM - Delay: >why would you fix something unfair?
5:23 PM - Coty: but its now an option in sf
5:24 PM - Delay: only time I'd be ok with leaving it on is if we go with rave's time based protection thing
5:25 PM - StruttingB4: this is all a bad idea considering
5:25 PM - Flinch: you could always just put some thought into your base designs
5:25 PM - StruttingB4: nothing coty programs ever works right
5:25 PM - Delay: and even then I wouldn't want tnt blocks to stick to slime bllocks
5:26 PM - Delay: what thought could you possibly put into a base design to repel that shit?
5:26 PM - Flinch: /tg/ tier thought
5:26 PM - Delay: hurr durr line the walls with furnaces

5:27 PM - Coty: what
5:27 PM - StruttingB4: REPORT IT TO PATCH RIGHT AFTER I REPAIR THE FACTION'S ARMOR
5:27 PM - StruttingB4: do you even know about that?
5:27 PM - Coty: I seriously have no idea what you're talking about
5:27 PM - StruttingB4: jesus fuck
5:27 PM - Delay: the what now?
5:28 PM - StruttingB4: in v6
5:28 PM - StruttingB4: if you broke a block with an item with health in your hand\
5:28 PM - StruttingB4: that item would get fully healed
5:28 PM - Coty: how was that my fault?
5:28 PM - Delay: and how is that his fault?
5:28 PM - Coty: I never messed with health
5:28 PM - Delay: you think he programmed everything that was used in v6, you chucklefuck?

10:17 PM - Coty: tl;dr fuck off
10:17 PM - Bob the Biscuit: kek
10:21 PM - Coty: anyways the post fetcher is finished for 8chan
10:21 PM - Coty: works asyncronously and everything
10:21 PM - Coty: heh, http://puu.sh/db6ld/d89e6167b9.jpg
10:21 PM - Coty: it found https://8chan.co/x/res/6907.html
10:22 PM - Coty: and a bunch of threads on the 4craft board
10:22 PM - Bob the Biscuit: there was one earlier
10:22 PM - Bob the Biscuit: on /x/
10:22 PM - Bob the Biscuit: but it must have been deleted and replaced with this
10:23 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >some random indie I play left some new unused assets in a store spritesheet
10:23 PM - Coty: I should probably hardcode it to not count /4craft/ posts
10:23 PM - Bob the Biscuit: oh boy the hype is out of control
10:23 PM - Coty: lol
10:23 PM - Bob the Biscuit: You could add some sort of exclude option
10:24 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Unless you're never gonna release the program and only gonna use it for 4craft and stalking people
10:24 PM - Coty: only for 4craft and stalking
10:25 PM - Bob the Biscuit: NSA most likely allready copied your program and made it scan every thread
10:25 PM - Coty: lol
10:25 PM - Coty: hotwheels told me you get 503 errors for a few hours if you attempt to do 6,000 fetches to quickly
10:25 PM - Coty: which I'm pretty sure is way less than the number of threads
10:26 PM - Hollapatrol left chat.
10:26 PM - Coty: anyways since this is finished now
10:26 PM - Coty: I could use it to do other shit
10:26 PM - Coty: like
10:26 PM - Coty: >player posted a thread on 8chan about 4craft
10:26 PM - Coty: >gets sticks
10:26 PM - Coty: ideas?
10:27 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Shouldn't be anything major
10:27 PM - Bob the Biscuit: like they could get a "shill" chat title
10:27 PM - Coty: could be a temporary power boost
10:27 PM - Coty: or that
10:27 PM - Bob the Biscuit: nah there shouldn't be anything that can effect the game majorly
10:28 PM - Bob the Biscuit: I mean if you're getting raided you can just post tons of threads to get powerboosted kek
10:28 PM - Coty: nah, I'd only do one powerboost per faction
10:28 PM - Coty: could ensure that people are always posting about it
10:28 PM - 吉川ちなつ lol FSU always wins faggot entered chat.
10:28 PM - Coty: I could make the script also sift through the post contents, not just the subject
10:29 PM - Coty: and scan for little things like "/a/" or "/lgbt/" in the content area
10:29 PM - Coty: so the thing would know who is posting and not make it look like a shill post
10:30 PM - Coty: changed formatting a bit
10:30 PM - Coty: http://puu.sh/db6Mm/36b10afc1d.jpg
10:31 PM - Coty: https://8chan.co/v/res/1196420.html was my test post

10:47 PM - Coty: if anyone wants to sift through the code
10:53 PM - Bob the Biscuit: So does it ignore previously mentioned threads?
10:53 PM - Coty: not right now
10:53 PM - Coty: probably won't
10:53 PM - Bob the Biscuit: hwo long does it update, cause it's gponna spam chat to death if people post threads alot
10:54 PM - Coty: right now its every ~10 minutes, but I'll probably change it to once an hour
10:55 PM - Coty: also it takes a full 6 minutes on my machine to scan through them all (although most of that time is just downloading it; but I think my download speed is faster than 8chan's upload atm)
10:55 PM - Bob the Biscuit: A way to ignore it would be nice, like have it in it's own specific channel or post via a /ignore-able user
10:55 PM - Coty: might do that later
10:56 PM - Coty: I just added a thing so it shows the text in gold if the post is doubles lol
10:56 PM - Bob the Biscuit: kekku

11:12 PM - Centipede519: I am going to actually play this for the first time since v2 (though I stuck around on v4 for like 2 days) because I have an actual computer this time and not a shitty laptop. Can't wait to get the full autism experience
11:12 PM - D.J - Fred: what faction are you playing for
11:13 PM - Coty: inb4 no funding and no server
11:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: You missed the giga autism of V5
11:13 PM - Centipede519: I am playing for /a/ as I have since the pre-beta shit
11:13 PM - D.J - Fred: ayyy
11:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >/a/
11:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: ayyyyy
11:13 PM - Coty: somebody link the video
11:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: My one?
11:13 PM - Coty: yeah
11:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: one sec
11:13 PM - Centipede519: I helped dig the rail to /jp/ in V1 I remember
11:14 PM - Centipede519: In fact, the 2nd rail was primarily my work
11:14 PM - Bob the Biscuit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2nQoNuT6eA
11:14 PM - Coty: this was the best
11:14 PM - Centipede519: I wish I was there for this ;_;
11:14 PM - Coty: I hope you make more like this bob
11:15 PM - Bob the Biscuit: If I can get half decent footage I'll make a video one it
11:15 PM - D.J - Fred: you missed /a/ winning everything
11:15 PM - Centipede519: The one thing I've been doing recently is Civcraft. Which has been dying because no one went to war with Reddit and people gradually got tired of the political shenanigans and up and went to play other games
11:15 PM - Bob the Biscuit: kek I remember me scrambling through documentation to abort an auto restart
11:15 PM - Coty: haha
11:15 PM - Centipede519: Though, it's only a /v/, /int/, /pol/ and /b/ city on civcraft
11:16 PM - Bob the Biscuit: The giga niga shitstorm at the end was brilliant
11:16 PM - Coty: I played civcraft for like 10 minutes
11:16 PM - Coty: I started tearing down a house and stole literally 256 exp potions and used them all
11:16 PM - Coty: I managed to break 3 houses before the owner of the town found me
11:16 PM - Coty: he put me in some jail and then I stopped playing
11:17 PM - Centipede519: I established myself as Kovio's qt trap gf as well as the one who has been building an autismal tower for the past like 2 months
11:17 PM - Centipede519: I am not ready to give Civcraft up until I fucking war with leddit
11:19 PM - Bob the Biscuit: It would never happen but getting the all the 4craft players on civcraft vs leddit would be hilarious
11:20 PM - Centipede519: I've been thinking of forming a resource illuminati by hoarding EXP and diamonds so prot IV armor can be mass produced and distributed to everyone and that might become a reality

2:47 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: djinra is done
2:47 AM - Delay: is he?
2:47 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: we could have the 15 year old serbian do it
2:47 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: since he's "djinra"
2:48 AM - Delay: which one?
2:48 AM - Delay: DJ?
2:48 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: dante
2:48 AM - Delay: close enough
2:48 AM - Delay: djinra is done? did he relinquish the steam group?
2:49 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: well
2:49 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: he said he wasn't taking part in v7
2:49 AM - Delay: he said the same about v5
2:49 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: which more than likely means he's met his autistic match
2:49 AM - Delay: v6 as well I think
2:49 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: an opponent finally as autismo as he
2:50 AM - Dante: Huh
2:50 AM - Dante: What do you want
2:50 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: go back to removing kebab
2:50 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: i call when need kebab removal services
2:50 AM - Delay: he never says he's going to play until it gets a successful beta
2:50 AM - Delay: then he uses his status as group owner to sieze control
2:50 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: see
2:50 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: there's kinda a movement in /a/
2:50 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: where some of the group members
2:50 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: want to move on to different groups
2:51 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: which'll possibly make it "fun"
2:51 AM - Delay: kek
2:51 AM - Dante: That means that i can replace them ?
2:51 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: I dunno
2:51 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: prolly.
2:51 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: but jack and I were talking about moving some of /a/ over to /pol/ or /sp/
2:51 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: for the #ladbants
2:51 AM - Delay: I'll join /a/ if djinra takes no part
2:52 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: but people like strutting want the group to stay as a whole
2:52 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: because if djinra isnt leader
2:52 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: then it's more than likely rave
2:52 AM - Dante: Just make rave the leader and we're done
2:52 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: >rave
2:52 AM - Delay: and rave is a bro
2:53 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: I feel like if /a/ were to split up, it'd be the best for memecraft
2:53 AM - Dante: didnt they already have loli and /a/
2:53 AM - Delay: no
2:53 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: because the best players from every faction aren't on one stacked team
2:53 AM - Delay: I think
2:53 AM - Tomato: alister left /a/
2:54 AM - Tomato: so that's our best player gone
2:54 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: rip alister
2:54 AM - Delay: that's like 20% of the best players already
2:54 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: djinra is not playing in v7
2:54 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: so
2:54 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: that's our autistic planner
2:54 AM - Delay: don't believe his lies, jihad
2:54 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: are we going to get another edgy tumblr post?
2:55 AM - Delay: will I need to poop one out?
2:55 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: it'd be swell
2:56 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: but we've got some amout of odd days
2:56 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: to see what'll happen to /a/ as a whole
2:56 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: it'll be a "fun" journey, I can assure you of that.

9:51 AM - Delay: ded gem
9:51 AM - Pip: 4craft is finished
9:52 AM - Dante: Do you regret donating 75$
9:53 AM - Pip: no regrets
9:53 AM - Pip: id donate all $250 but need hype
9:54 AM - Pip: too much lack of hype
9:54 AM - Dante: nice
9:54 AM - Delay: no hype can be made before server details are decided on
9:54 AM - Delay: like settings and the map
9:54 AM - Pip: jk im not going to donate much more
9:54 AM - Delay: so just waiting on that
9:54 AM - Pip: some other fags need to participate in the donations
9:55 AM - Pip: there were plenty of people willing to donate in v5
9:55 AM - Pip: when we had a week of server issues
9:55 AM - Delay: because
9:55 AM - Pip: where did they go
9:55 AM - Mawr: No one wants to donate because no server details
9:55 AM - Delay: server details
9:55 AM - Mawr: No server details because no donations :^)
9:56 AM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader disconnected.
9:56 AM - Delay: we set up the server details
9:56 AM - Delay: we had a fucking livestream Q&A
9:56 AM - Mawr: wot
9:56 AM - Mawr: when
9:56 AM - Pip: maybe we should rent a cheap $20 vpnfor 4craft and then people will send money becuause they cant take the lag
9:56 AM - Delay: and suggestions nad shit
9:56 AM - Mawr: oh talking about v5?
9:57 AM - Delay: yeah
9:57 AM - Pip: >server details
9:57 AM - Delay: tfw jumping into v5 ts chat shortly after finding out people were gonna do it
9:58 AM - Mawr: it would be best to come up with the balance settings, sort most things out and announce 'we only need a server'
9:58 AM - Pip: if i boght a $250 server right now for 4craft could i get some of my money back later?
9:58 AM - Delay: tfw organizing that shitfest that was going nowhere
9:58 AM - Pip: people wont want to donate after we have the server either
9:58 AM - Pip: >they have the server, they dont need sheks
9:58 AM - Delay: "who's good at taking notes? you? ok, take down notes, we're gonna start talking important shit"
9:59 AM - Pip: need more admins
9:59 AM - Delay: "you're good too? you're the backup note taker"
9:59 AM - Pip: admins to make plans
9:59 AM - Pip: coty can be plugin dev
9:59 AM - Pip: which he seems to be doing ok at right now
9:59 AM - Pip: im not sure what thor does
10:00 AM - Pip: everyone seems to love patch
10:00 AM - Delay: damn that was fun, getting people to keep their shit together
10:00 AM - Delay: thor does literally nothing
10:00 AM - Delay: patch didn't want to do anything but settled for adminning the live server
10:00 AM - Delay: iirc
10:01 AM - Delay: I've suggested my server settings to coty
10:01 AM - Delay: he said they were neat but then we went on to talk about the sf plugin and stuff
10:02 AM - Pip: like they need to decide and make a post about what the server have
10:02 AM - Pip: expected player slots
10:02 AM - Pip: plugins
10:02 AM - Pip: map
10:02 AM - Pip: i dont see issues with the old maps
10:03 AM - Pip: ofc earth would be cool
10:03 AM - Pip: but the old maps are fine too
10:03 AM - Pip: they work
10:03 AM - Delay: I don't like earth
10:03 AM - Delay: board related islands is best
10:03 AM - Pip: use v6 map and be done with it
10:03 AM - Mawr: old and boring
10:04 AM - Mawr: well not old, the opposite
10:04 AM - Delay: and missing out on 1.8 shit
10:04 AM - Pip: cant use v6 on 1.8?
10:04 AM - Delay: I'm for 1.8 custom presets
10:04 AM - Delay: well we can
10:04 AM - Pip: are there new ores or somthing?
10:04 AM - Delay: it'll just be missing the new shit
10:04 AM - Delay: blocks

11:01 AM - Coty: hey man, I have to keep the account active for my occassional vidya shilling
11:02 AM - Coty: besides not all of reddit is bad, I lurk some boards like /r/bitcoin and /r/playrust, that's really it though
11:02 AM - Pip: Reddit Gold-Level User, Intellectual, Brony, Atheist, Bi-Gendered, Trilby Tipper; at your service m'ladies!
11:03 AM - Pip: r bitcoin is bad
11:03 AM - Coty: depends on what you use it for
11:03 AM - Pip: https://twitter.com/shit_rbtc_says
11:03 AM - Coty: for normal conversation and speaking to rational bitcoin enthusiasts of reddit; it's fucking awful
11:03 AM - Coty: for just seeing bitcoin news it's pretty alright
11:04 AM - Pip: all i know of it is from that twitter account
11:04 AM - Coty: probably ran by an /r/buttcoin member hue
11:04 AM - Pip: its someone tweeting the craziest posts they can find
11:04 AM - Coty: "What Einstein did for physics, Satoshi has done for money." although I do agree with this one
11:05 AM - Coty: "No, Bitcoin does not need to adapt to the society. Society needs to adapt to bitcoin." isn't wrong either, really
11:07 AM - Pip: I have lost more than 2 year's worth of salary on bitcoin this year and I still feel compelled to buy more.
11:07 AM - Pip: XD to the moon
11:07 AM - Coty: lmao
11:07 AM - Coty: I've got a buddy who's as big on bitcoin as I am; we'll laugh at shit like this too don't worry
11:07 AM - Pip: i mined litecoin for a month
11:08 AM - Pip: converted it to 2 bitcoins
11:08 AM - Pip: sold for $200
11:08 AM - Coty: nice, back when the price was lower I assume?
11:08 AM - Coty: aww yes
11:08 AM - Pip: then it went up to like 1000 2 months later
11:08 AM - Coty: hue
11:08 AM - Coty: It's only at $350ish right now, keeps waving between $300 - $450
11:08 AM - Pip: then i bought 1 bitcoin
11:08 AM - Coty: oh nooo
11:08 AM - Pip: for $1000
11:08 AM - Coty: bad bad bad
11:08 AM - Pip: never reovered
11:09 AM - Pip: i sold for $800
11:09 AM - Coty: do you still have it?
11:09 AM - Coty: noooo
11:09 AM - Pip: could have funsed 4craft
11:09 AM - Pip: funded
11:09 AM - Coty: never sell pip
11:09 AM - Pip: never buy
11:09 AM - Pip: never buy buttcoin
11:09 AM - Coty: buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own
11:09 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >tfw had 500 bitcoin at one point ;-;
11:09 AM - Coty: is what I go by
11:09 AM - Coty: I had about $400 in bitcoin last month, bought while it was $250 or so
11:10 AM - Coty: I had to sell it last week for food though ;_;
11:10 AM - Coty: made a tiny profit I guess but still
11:10 AM - Pip: i do real markets now
11:10 AM - Coty: I wish I had the income to just buy a ton
11:10 AM - Pip: the stock market
11:10 AM - Coty: I've played with penny stocks but I can't afford anything big
11:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >short selling UBM stocks
11:10 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: feels good meng
11:10 AM - Pip: penny stocks are the only thing ive lost money
11:10 AM - Pip: ive lost money in ocz and amd
11:11 AM - Pip: every single other thing im positive on
11:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Keep in AMD
11:11 AM - Pip: penny stocks never again
11:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It'll go up
11:11 AM - Pip: im not selling amd
11:11 AM - Coty: lol
11:11 AM - Pip: i didnt sell ocz either
11:11 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's hit until 2016
11:11 AM - Coty: yeah I'd imagine video card companie stocks would be going up soon
11:11 AM - Coty: especially AMD
11:11 AM - Coty: since nvidia jsut released their baby
11:11 AM - Pip: amd is the only thing i own that doesnt pay dividends either
11:11 AM - Coty: and AMD is probably going to show something big soon
11:11 AM - Pip: nvidia is my most profitable stock
11:11 AM - Pip: 40% gain
11:11 AM - Coty: nice
11:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah the 980 got people hyped for some reason
11:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It wasn't better than the 780 Ti
11:12 AM - Pip: rightfully so
11:12 AM - Pip: it overclocks better and uses less power
11:12 AM - Pip: 1.5ghz
11:12 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It overclocks the same, it just has a higher base and max clock
11:12 AM - Pip: less shaders right/
11:12 AM - Pip: it had somthing less
11:13 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
11:13 AM - Coty: tfw my HD 7850 is finally starting to die, I get tiny red pixel static on pure black
11:13 AM - Coty: it hurts to live man
11:13 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: GK110 was a terribly inefficient design
11:13 AM - Pip: also cheap
11:13 AM - Pip: 970 is great value
11:13 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: GK110 is 780 Ti / Titan / 780 dude
11:14 AM - Coty: the next card I'll get is probably a 970 when I can afford it
11:14 AM - Pip: 970 will get you 60 fps 1080p forever
11:14 AM - Pip: unless the game is shit
11:14 AM - Coty: I plan on getting it and an oculus rift at the same time
11:14 AM - Coty: probably next summer
11:15 AM - Coty: rift should be out by then and it'll give me an excuse to finally upgrade
11:15 AM - Pip: amd has somthing exciting in the works
11:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: IIRC the average 780 Ti OC was 1.2ghz
11:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Stock clock was 875mhz
11:16 AM - Coty: does the 970 support the new (still unfinished) openGL standard?
11:16 AM - Coty: or will we have to wait another generation?
11:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That means a 37% OC
11:16 AM - Coty: I'm betting the next big AMD card will have it
11:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: The stock clock of the 980 is 1126mhz
11:17 AM - Pip: i think the 390x is supposed to have stacked memory
11:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You claim an average OC of 1500, I've heard it was 1400
11:17 AM - Coty: neat
11:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Even in your best case scenario given
11:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's only a 33% OC
11:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: so no
11:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It doesn't overclock better
11:17 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: faggot
11:17 AM - Coty: so angry over video games
11:17 AM - Pip: ok fag you win
11:17 AM - Coty: speaking of video games
11:17 AM - Pip: i surrender
11:17 AM - Coty: monkeys
11:17 AM - Pip: cant we be friends
11:18 AM - Coty: do you plan on doing a map or whatever for v7
11:18 AM - Coty: or should we just randomly generate?
11:18 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: no unless they pay me
11:18 AM - Coty: I'm really tempted to re use the v4 man
11:18 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No
11:18 AM - Coty: but I think people would hate me
11:18 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: god no
11:18 AM - Coty: ;_;
11:18 AM - Coty: rip floating islands
11:18 AM - Coty: well if you did the map again you could just do it in your spare time
11:18 AM - Coty: we have a month
11:18 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I said I'd do this for $80 http://i.imgur.com/RGNdaeh.jpg
11:19 AM - Coty: heh
11:19 AM - Coty: that looks finished-ish though
11:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: ebin
11:19 AM - Coty: just lacking detail and biomes
11:19 AM - Coty: no?
11:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
11:19 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: The coastlines are the issue
11:19 AM - Coty: explain
11:20 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: They're all fucked up
11:20 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Look at Eastern England
11:20 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Denmark
11:20 AM - Pip: coty what went wrong when you hosted it on your machine
11:20 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Turkey/Greece
11:20 AM - Pip: what made the lag
11:20 AM - Pip: hardware or internet?
11:20 AM - Coty: DDoS
11:20 AM - Coty: iirc
11:20 AM - Coty: they took down my entire campus's internet for a day
11:20 AM - Coty: was hilarious
11:20 AM - Coty: I was out of town though
11:20 AM - Mawr: it was internet + hardware too goy
11:20 AM - Coty: so my friend was calling me and telling me about it
11:21 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Didn't that happen whenever you restarted the server too
11:21 AM - Mawr: le single channel memory faec
11:21 AM - Coty: hardware not so much
11:21 AM - Coty: I swapped out my main PC with the server box
11:21 AM - Coty: mix/matched hardware to get the best I could
11:21 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And OC'd the memory, that was a big thing
11:21 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That was a big limiter it turned out for a bit
11:21 AM - Pip: tell the university you need to use the strongest server they have for a "social" experiment
11:22 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kek
11:22 AM - Coty: when I was hosting it was running with 16 GB of DDR3 RAM (two 8GB sticks), my 8530 (8 core, OC'd to almost 5 GHz)
11:22 AM - Mawr: too bad the uni internet is shit
11:22 AM - Coty: not "server" hardware but plenty fast
11:22 AM - Coty: uni internet wasn't shit, it could handle 300 players easily, it was just the constant DDoS that it oculdn;'t handle
11:22 AM - Coty: MC itself isn't a big hog
11:23 AM - Coty: looked like it took roughly 10Mb/s per 100 players
11:23 AM - Coty: both up and down
11:23 AM - Mawr: ping not speed
11:23 AM - Coty: oh yeah, there were a ton of extra hops
11:23 AM - Coty: so ping was probably an issue
11:23 AM - Coty: since it was in my apartment living room
11:24 AM - Coty: I remember one of the hops went through a domain called THORSNET
11:24 AM - Coty: which was hilarious as well
11:26 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: remove uni
11:26 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: uni worst uni
11:27 AM - Pip: setup beta with limited slots on your machine for hype
11:27 AM - Pip: then move to real server for real thing
11:27 AM - Pip: is it as simply as copy and pasting?
11:28 AM - Pip: simple*
11:28 AM - Pip: to move servers
11:28 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Nah you gotta recompile everything :^)
11:28 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: nah just fuckin
11:28 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: theres a few things
11:28 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Uni should be able to handle shit better than last time anyways
11:28 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That was uhhhh
11:28 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 1.6
11:28 AM - Coty: uni isn't an option this time, unfortunately
11:28 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 1.7 put in a new network engine
11:29 AM - Pip: how good is spigot
11:29 AM - Coty: I live off campus now
11:29 AM - Coty: spigot is pretty rad
11:29 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And 1.8 added linux optimizations
11:29 AM - Coty: neat
11:29 AM - Coty: but yeah pip its literally copy/paste files and install any dependancies (ie java)
11:29 AM - Coty: you also need to setup scripts and whatnot to make sure the server never stays offline for to long, etc
11:30 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: log everyones IP and passwor
11:30 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: manage the backdoor inserter
11:30 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: etc
11:30 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Gotta mine them bitcoins
11:30 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: :^_
11:30 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: :^)
11:30 AM - Pip: i set up a bukkit server for friends a long long time ago
11:31 AM - Pip: i think it was called somthing different back then
11:31 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Nah
11:31 AM - Pip: its more complicated now
11:31 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's always been Bukkit/Craftbukkit
11:32 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Bukkit is the API, Craftbukkit is the implementation
11:32 AM - Coty: ^
11:32 AM - Coty: spigot is just a fork of bukkit
11:32 AM - Coty: so most plugins are still compatible
11:32 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Uses a bunch of Craftbukkit too right?
11:32 AM - Coty: right
11:32 AM - vlinder left chat.
11:36 AM - Delay: what did I miss?
11:36 AM - Delay: December is tomorrow
11:36 AM - Pip: 4craft v7 happened
11:36 AM - Delay: what are you gonna do about server settings?
11:37 AM - Delay: we need info so we can hype it before christmas
11:37 AM - Pip: yes
11:37 AM - Pip: its hype time
11:37 AM - Delay: so you can get the server funding from donations through the hype
11:37 AM - Delay: before christmas
11:37 AM - D.J - Fred: make a google docs again
11:37 AM - Delay: hell, before normalfags do their christmas shopping
11:38 AM - Delay: a lesson from previous crap launches
11:39 AM - Delay: was to have everything ready well before actual launch
11:40 AM - Mawr: Is it time for a doc huehue
11:40 AM - Pip: begin it
11:40 AM - Delay: can't begin one when there's nothing confirmed
11:40 AM - Mawr: too bad google killed the comment system
11:40 AM - Coty: man seriously
11:40 AM - Coty: is there an alternative?
11:40 AM - Mawr: yes
11:40 AM - Mawr: create a thread with the doc linked
11:41 AM - Mawr: on the steam group
11:41 AM - Coty: heh
11:41 AM - Pip: its going to say kek on every line with no info
11:42 AM - Delay: coty, go with my settings or what?
11:42 AM - Delay: gotta know
11:43 AM - Delay: either way I'm gonna keep working on it but still, it's the only thing I know of related to v7 settings right now
11:43 AM - Pip: what are the things you have delay?
11:43 AM - Pip: for settings
11:43 AM - Mawr: add pvp death messages pls
11:43 AM - Pip: that would be cool
11:44 AM - Pip: /a/ player name kill /pol/ player name
11:44 AM - Pip: wars could begin
11:44 AM - Pip: killed*
11:44 AM - Mawr: It would be best if you could get coty to integrate them with simplefactions
11:44 AM - Coty: oh man, good idea
11:44 AM - Coty: yeah
11:44 AM - Delay: they can use more work and >balance but yeah
11:44 AM - Mawr: not really as long as there are limiting options
11:45 AM - Mawr: >you only see death messages related to your faction and your allies
11:45 AM - Delay: *pvp death messages
11:45 AM - Mawr: that would be for the worst case scenario, where there would be too much spam otherwise
11:45 AM - Mawr: yea
11:45 AM - Mawr: maybe enable regular death messages for own faction?
11:45 AM - Delay: https://8chan.co/4craft/res/167.html#227
11:46 AM - Delay: more or less the settings I had
11:46 AM - Pip: yes so we can know who lost the full set of diamond armor we just gave them
11:46 AM - Delay: I might as well write up a proper one for documentation
11:46 AM - Delay: of my current "build"
11:46 AM - Pip: is that server still up?
11:48 AM - Delay: no
11:48 AM - Delay: but
11:48 AM - Delay: http://puu.sh/damcI/93adba0220.7z
11:48 AM - Delay: what I sent coty
11:50 AM - Delay: it's lacking the latest sf build though
11:51 AM - Coty: okay so I just added a thing to death messages
11:51 AM - Delay: neat
11:51 AM - Coty: basically it scans through all of the players online and if their name matches a part of the death message, it replaces their name in the death message with " /faction/ playername "
11:51 AM - Coty: just a simple injection
11:52 AM - Delay: now make it do a backflip
11:52 AM - Coty: http://puu.sh/dbOhE/e5da4226ce.png
11:59 AM - Mawr: remove that  comment
11:59 AM - Mawr: the redundancy
12:00 PM - Coty: http://puu.sh/dbOVJ/76bdd213fe.png
12:01 PM - Coty: it works, http://puu.sh/dbOY5/c71a502837.png
12:01 PM - Mawr: noice
12:01 PM - Coty: it's the little things
12:01 PM - Pip: are you going to have it so it only shows up for factions involved?
12:01 PM - Pip: else it will be spam
12:01 PM - Coty: nah
12:01 PM - Coty: we usually have death messages turned off
12:01 PM - Coty: but I think we should leave them on this time
12:01 PM - Mawr: pvp death messages
12:01 PM - Coty: unless you guys disagree
12:02 PM - Pip: i dont mind either way
12:02 PM - Pip: i really like this though
12:02 PM - Mawr: pretty much what i've said above
12:02 PM - Delay: >not reading chat
12:02 PM - Mawr: global all death messages would be cancer
12:02 PM - Mawr: pvp only might or might not be bad
12:02 PM - Pip: could trigger drama when a certain faction kills a player of another
12:02 PM - Pip: i like
12:03 PM - Coty: I could probably make it pvp only
12:03 PM - Delay: limit death messages to factionxfaction and when somebody in your faction dies
12:03 PM - Coty: let me see if I can find the function for canceling death messages
12:03 PM - Mawr: 19:45 - Mawr: >you only see death messages related to your faction and your allies
19:45 - Delay: *pvp death messages
19:45 - Mawr: that would be for the worst case scenario, where there would be too much spam otherwise
19:45 - Mawr: yea
19:45 - Mawr: maybe enable regular death messages for own faction?
12:04 PM - Mawr: would be best to have an option to either show all pvp messages or what delay said
12:04 PM - Mawr: uh or only faction-related
12:05 PM - Mawr: Option 1: All pvp death messages
12:05 PM - Mawr: Option 2: Only you faction-related, maybe all death messages for own faction
12:05 PM - Mawr: there
12:05 PM - Delay: 2 es best
12:05 PM - Pip: option 2 but with allies
12:05 PM - Coty: I would do 2 if I can find out how
12:05 PM - Delay: with all death messages for own faction
12:05 PM - Coty: it doesn't look like there's anything in the API to cancel messages
12:06 PM - Mawr: no way
12:06 PM - Coty: yeah, I can't find it at least
12:06 PM - Pip: if you cant do it i still like option q
12:06 PM - Pip: 1
12:06 PM - Pip: better than nothing
12:07 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader entered chat.
12:07 PM - Mawr: with option 1 we might end up disabling the messages because of spam
12:07 PM - Delay: dat one guy in v5 beta who kept killing himself
12:07 PM - Delay: bless his soul
12:08 PM - Coty: I have an idea
12:09 PM - Delay: Delay: what are you gonna do about server settings?
Delay: we need info so we can hype it before christmas
Pip: yes
Pip: its hype time
Delay: so you can get the server funding from donations through the hype
Delay: before christmas
D.J - Fred: make a google docs again
Delay: hell, before normalfags do their christmas shopping
Delay: a lesson from previous crap launches
Delay: was to have everything ready well before actual launch
Mawr: Is it time for a doc huehue
Pip: begin it
12:09 PM - Mawr: Option 1: All pvp death messages
Option 2: All death messages for your faction only.
Option 3: Option 2 + pvp death messages for allied factions.
12:09 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: I want pvp death messages
12:09 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: so my shitposting sword can be seen
12:09 PM - Delay: 3 is best but hardest
12:09 PM - Coty: okay so
12:10 PM - Coty: I got option 1
12:10 PM - Coty: but that's all I can do
12:10 PM - Pip: alright
12:10 PM - Mawr: git gud
12:10 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: I want the entire server to see that suchandsuch was killed by >he does it for free
12:10 PM - Coty: I can cancel messages globally, but not per person
12:10 PM - Coty: so I just set any death message not involving two people to null
12:10 PM - Coty: which apparently cancels the event
12:10 PM - Delay: how about per faction?
12:10 PM - Coty: can't
12:10 PM - Delay: damn
12:10 PM - Mawr: mute globally and re-send to chosen players?
12:10 PM - Pip: rewrite bukkit u pleb
12:10 PM - Mawr: cant do that?
12:10 PM - Pip: jk
12:10 PM - Coty: reached the limit on what we can do with bukkit lol
12:10 PM - Coty: sorry guys
12:11 PM - Delay: np
12:11 PM - Delay: alright so
12:11 PM - Delay: server settings
12:11 PM - Delay: what are your plans?
12:11 PM - Coty: none yet
12:11 PM - Delay: we need info to shill shit
12:11 PM - Mawr: ebin
12:11 PM - Delay: what about my settings?
12:11 PM - Coty: I just know we're doing simplefactions with the settings on lenient
12:11 PM - Pip: i liked delays settings only think i question is armor weight, but even that is fine
12:11 PM - Coty: I haven't looked over your stuff yet
12:11 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: it doesn't matter who we are
12:11 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: what matters is our plan
12:11 PM - Mawr: armor weight is neat
12:11 PM - Delay: armor weight can be removed
12:12 PM - Coty: I saw the armor weight, I liked that one
12:12 PM - Delay: if it's too much of a bother
12:12 PM - Delay: I like it too
12:12 PM - Delay: you can make armor give you SPEED
12:12 PM - Delay: leatherarmor gofast
12:12 PM - Mawr: really feels like there is added depth to armor choosing
12:12 PM - Coty: I think it'd be rad if wearing no armor made you faster than normal
12:12 PM - Coty: but wearing diamond made you a slug
12:12 PM - Delay: you can do that as well
12:12 PM - Coty: let's do that
12:12 PM - Coty: and have it scale linearly
12:12 PM - Pip: day 1 id have a macro that takes my armor off
12:13 PM - Pip: and puts it on
12:13 PM - Delay: it's ok
12:13 PM - Coty: we could have a thing that delays how fast you can remove items
12:13 PM - Delay: there's some inventory limiting shit that's possible
12:13 PM - Coty: I can program that right now if we wanted
12:13 PM - Pip: fug hes shutting it down
12:13 PM - Mawr: no armour should be normal speed
12:13 PM - Coty: I'd vote for 1.25x speed
12:13 PM - Mawr: thats for leather goy
12:13 PM - Coty: leather being 1.10x
12:14 PM - Mawr: why should the plebs be fast
12:14 PM - Coty: it only makes sense to go faster when you're wearing nothing
12:14 PM - Delay: yeah but
12:14 PM - Mawr: >realism
12:14 PM - Delay: this isn't realism
12:14 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: >he doesnt run faster in full sanic blue diamond
12:14 PM - Coty: just makes sense yo
12:14 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: shiggy diggy
12:14 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: shiggy diggy
12:14 PM - Delay: >not wanting to wear blue leather armor and go fast
12:14 PM - Mawr: protip: you can carry tonnes of gold on you
12:14 PM - Coty: alright alright
12:14 PM - Coty: can we make blue specifically go faster?
12:14 PM - Coty: :3c
12:14 PM - Delay: if you want to mod it
12:15 PM - Coty: is it open source?
12:15 PM - Delay: possibly
12:15 PM - Coty: link me fag
12:15 PM - Mawr: >killing variety
12:15 PM - Delay: it's bukkit
12:15 PM - Mawr: pls
12:15 PM - Coty: either way
12:15 PM - Coty: I feel like I'm going to tamper a lot
12:15 PM - Coty: so we can get really customizable
12:15 PM - Delay: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/armorweight/
12:16 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: imagine going 300x with dyed blue armour
12:16 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: jesus christ
12:16 PM - Jihad Joe: A Real ISIS Beheader: sanic3stronk
12:16 PM - Coty: cool it is
12:16 PM - Delay: alright then
12:17 PM - Delay: let's talk my setup then
12:17 PM - Delay: after I document the notable stuff
12:19 PM - Pip: i want sanic armor
12:19 PM - Coty: the guy who wrote the plugin made it so you can fetch which piece of armor it is
12:19 PM - Coty: so I could easily make hats give more speed than say boots
12:19 PM - Coty: probably won't, but it's possible lol
12:20 PM - Delay: pumpkins do something like that
12:20 PM - Delay: the pieces of armor each contribute to the total weight in %
12:21 PM - Delay: or something
12:23 PM - Mawr: http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/event/player/AsyncPlayerChatEvent.html
12:23 PM - Mawr: This the thing coty?
12:23 PM - Coty: unfortunately no
12:23 PM - Coty: it doesn't trigger a chat event
12:23 PM - Coty: its handled by the playerDeathEvent
12:24 PM - Delay: ArmorWeight - Modify player speed while wearing armor. http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/armorweight/
CraftManipulation - Lets you recieve more of an item when crafted. Used for TnT(3), Rails(4), and Fire Charges(24). http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/crafting-manipulation/
EnchantLimiter - Limits enchants (needs config). Affected enchants are the following: I Fire Aspect, I Punch, I Knockback, II Thorns, II Power, II Protection, III Sharpness, III Projectile Protection. 
TeleportationRunes - http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/teleportationrunes/
NoNpcTrade - Disables NPC trading. Probably removing to use 1.8 trading. 
ObsidianDestroyer - Obsidian and Enchant tables take 3 blasts to destroy. There's an interesting rebalancing possibility with how it's possible to have different blocks have higher blast resistance but I won't touch that for now. 
Can be used to raise hp of all blocks so we can turn off water blast resist.
12:24 PM - Coty: the only two functions are getter and setter functions
12:24 PM - Zemei: will any armies be running around nude?
12:24 PM - Delay: speed pots will be core
12:25 PM - Coty: >TeleportationRunes
12:25 PM - Coty: >not using Runecraft
12:25 PM - Delay: yes
12:25 PM - Delay: just need the tp, buddy
12:25 PM - Coty: you can set runecraft to only allow tp
12:25 PM - Coty: runecraft does it all asyncrounously so its probably way more effecient
12:25 PM - Delay: or you can use this
12:25 PM - Delay: is that so?
12:25 PM - Coty: yeah
12:26 PM - Coty: like it was crazy how optimized that code was when I got to look through it
12:26 PM - Delay: well I'm not an expert at this shit
12:26 PM - Coty: the dev is a literal autist
12:26 PM - Delay: so compare the two or something to be sure
12:26 PM - Mawr: I like runecraft's tp thingos better
12:26 PM - Delay: how exactly do they work?
12:26 PM - Mawr: similarly
12:26 PM - Delay: or how do you pull it off
12:26 PM - Mawr: higher learning curve
12:27 PM - Delay: how so?
12:27 PM - Delay: inb4 chat commands
12:27 PM - Mawr: harder to remember how to place the blocks
12:27 PM - Mawr: nah
12:27 PM - Coty: looks like runecraft is up to date too
12:27 PM - Mawr: just more complexity
12:27 PM - Coty: 1.7.10 build out, they posted a comment saying they are working on 1.8
12:27 PM - Coty: looks like a new dev too
12:27 PM - Coty: fucking rivkiin
12:27 PM - Pip: are we aiming for 1.8 4craft?
12:28 PM - Coty: he's an autist too
12:28 PM - Coty: most likely
12:28 PM - Coty: the only real complaint about 1.8 right now is performance
12:28 PM - Coty: I'm sure optifine will be updated soon
12:28 PM - Coty: so it'll probably be fine
12:28 PM - Delay: I don't want it to be too complicated
12:29 PM - Coty: http://ctri.co.uk/images/TP_scaled.gif
12:29 PM - Bob the Biscuit entered chat.
12:29 PM - Coty: http://ctri.co.uk/images/PP_scaled.gif
12:29 PM - Coty: just the first gif in this case
12:29 PM - Mawr: optifine's out m8
12:29 PM - Coty: well there we have it
12:29 PM - Coty: no excuse to not use 1.8 then
12:30 PM - Mawr: cant make >void setDeathMessage(String deathMessage)
12:30 PM - Mawr: not display a message?
12:30 PM - Coty: yes, if you set it to null, which I did for non pvp messages
12:30 PM - Delay: I like how the notrunecraft one works more
12:30 PM - Coty: but that only works globally
12:30 PM - Coty: you can't do it per person
12:31 PM - Delay: easier to remember
12:31 PM - Mawr: then can you not do that and then create a playerchat event?
12:31 PM - Coty: there's no way to check who is getting what message
12:31 PM - Coty: doesn't work that way ;_;
12:31 PM - Mawr: implications
12:31 PM - Delay: since it's much simpler for the same effect
12:31 PM - Coty: there might be a way but I can't figure it out
12:31 PM - Coty: trust me delay runecraft will be 100% better for waypoints
12:31 PM - Coty: I'll just disable all other runes
12:32 PM - Mawr: as long as no teleporting through walls
12:32 PM - Coty: I miss those days
12:32 PM - Bob the Biscuit: How long until people who know what they're doing with runecraft get banned like last time?
12:32 PM - Coty: just waypoint/teleport runes
12:32 PM - Coty: not much to know
12:32 PM - Mawr: 3d claiming on i presume?
12:32 PM - Coty: yeah, for sure
12:33 PM - Delay: then there's this shit about higher tier blocks
12:33 PM - Delay: man
12:33 PM - Bob the Biscuit: oh boy I can't wait for every waypoint code to end up in some trap
12:33 PM - Delay: I'm not liking this
12:33 PM - Mawr: well i would still like to be able to tp on top of blocks
12:33 PM - Coty: you don't have to use all that delay
12:33 PM - Mawr: if possible
12:33 PM - Coty: you can just make them out of cobble
12:33 PM - Coty: like most people do
12:33 PM - Delay: you don't have to but it's a thing
12:33 PM - Coty: you can place a few layers on top of waypoints
12:33 PM - Coty: to tp on top of them
12:33 PM - Coty: I think 7 or 8 is the limit
12:33 PM - Delay: muh burden of knowledge
12:34 PM - Mawr: mmkay
12:34 PM - Coty: you don't really gain anything from it, unless your password is garbage
12:34 PM - Mawr: as long as it doesnt tp you sideways
12:34 PM - Coty: referring to delay
12:34 PM - Coty: you can also do that
12:34 PM - Coty: up to 7 or 8 blocks
12:34 PM - Coty: but you have to set the waypoint from inside first
12:34 PM - Mawr: yea yea ok
12:34 PM - Coty: where you set it from is the side you'll tp to
12:35 PM - Coty: man I love runecraft, I'd love to have it 100% enabled
12:35 PM - Coty: I'll never live my dream though ;_;
12:35 PM - Mawr: fug off m8
12:35 PM - Bob the Biscuit: this kills the 4craft
12:35 PM - Archevei: ^
12:35 PM - Mawr: yes
12:35 PM - Archevei: bobo speaks the truth
12:35 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Everyone has enough autism to deal with m8
12:35 PM - Delay: I have a dream as well
12:35 PM - Bob the Biscuit: adding more giga autism to the mix will just kill it
12:35 PM - Mawr: >muh walls
12:35 PM - Coty: I hear ya
12:36 PM - Coty: NoNpcTrade - Disables NPC trading. Probably removing to use 1.8 trading.
12:36 PM - Coty: why this one?
12:36 PM - Delay: my dream is to massively restrict everyone into specific server enforced jobs
12:36 PM - Coty: lol
12:36 PM - StruttingB4 entered chat.
12:36 PM - Bob the Biscuit: "Oh boy someone turned the entire world upside down"
12:36 PM - Coty: man those were the best
12:36 PM - Delay: forcing everyone to rely on each other to get anything done
12:36 PM - Coty: topsy turvey runes
12:36 PM - Mawr: >oh boy half of my base is now lit tnt
12:36 PM - Coty: lmao
12:36 PM - Coty: phase blocks were the best
12:36 PM - Mawr: almost happened to jp
12:37 PM - Coty: >secret doors
12:37 PM - Coty: you literally had to scan walls just to be sure
12:37 PM - Delay: also to make hunger hardcore at the same time
12:37 PM - Coty: man fuck hunger
12:37 PM - Coty: shit's so stupid
12:37 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Did you ever see the stupid shit they put in V2?
12:37 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Well V2 was 99~% stupid shit
12:37 PM - Coty: maybe we nerf the fuck out of hunger
12:37 PM - Bob the Biscuit: but they made farming nearly impossible
12:37 PM - Coty: make it decrease 10x slower
12:37 PM - Mawr: git gud bob
12:38 PM - Coty: wait seriously here's an idea
12:38 PM - Delay: I think I still have a pastebin with my abandoned dream setup
12:38 PM - Mawr: it was only kinda hard at the beginning
12:38 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Gitting gud won't help if all my crops turn to grass in 5 seconds
12:38 PM - Coty: how baout when hunger reaches 80%, it starts decreasing 10x slower
12:38 PM - Archevei: r-rave
12:38 PM - Mawr: then it became a nuisance
12:38 PM - Archevei: what was zantrua's steam
12:38 PM - Mawr: hue
12:38 PM - Coty: that way you still need to eat, but it's not so damn annoying
12:39 PM - Mawr: that seems harmless
12:39 PM - Delay: >not making it so annoying it becomes a >fun feature
12:39 PM - Coty: something not so harmless I would love to do also would be add sleepers
12:39 PM - Coty: >when you log off you leave a sleeping version of your character in your base
12:39 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Delay you seem to want to kill this shit more than coty
12:39 PM - Coty: >it can be killed
12:39 PM - Coty: >must log off in a secure location
12:40 PM - Coty: yes/no?
12:40 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Wont that add hella load to the server or am I being stupid
12:40 PM - Delay: no, just talking about an idea I had
12:40 PM - Coty: not really
12:40 PM - Bob the Biscuit: 2000 sleepers at any time
12:40 PM - Pip: i kind of like sleepers
12:40 PM - Coty: they'd just be NPCs
12:40 PM - Bob the Biscuit: 1800 sorry
12:40 PM - Coty: not real players, just NPCs with a player skin
12:40 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Still gonna be 1800 little shits in the way
12:40 PM - Pip: will it drop our items?
12:40 PM - Mawr: duh pip
12:40 PM - Coty: also people will die a lot I'd assume, so there'd never be more than a few hundred of them
12:40 PM - Coty: yes, pip
12:41 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Well if it's always when you log off
12:41 PM - Bob the Biscuit: and V7 gets the same numbers as V5
12:41 PM - Bob the Biscuit: there's gonna be 1800 sleepers clogging up bases
12:41 PM - Coty: not necessarily true
12:41 PM - Coty: a lot of people will join just to check out the server and leave
12:41 PM - Coty: I'm guessing more than half
12:41 PM - Coty: so a lot of those people will log out around spawn
12:41 PM - Coty: meaning they'll be killed off
12:42 PM - Coty: and they won't have any logic
12:42 PM - Coty: just existing
12:42 PM - Coty: waiting to be killed
12:42 PM - Pip: will it strain server
12:42 PM - Coty: not much
12:42 PM - Bob the Biscuit: I don't really like it, using it for combat logging is alright but for all logoffs and them persisting for ever would be annoying
12:43 PM - Coty: Rust does it, and it's awesome
12:43 PM - Delay: I like it
12:43 PM - Delay: but then again
12:43 PM - Coty: it makes you feel like you really need to play often, to make sure shit didn't hit the fan while you were gone
12:43 PM - Coty: so it'll help with player retention
12:43 PM - Mawr: lel
12:43 PM - Mawr: coty pls
12:43 PM - Delay: consider rave's thing
12:43 PM - Mawr: its the opposite
12:43 PM - Bob the Biscuit: confirmed here for jewing and not fun
12:44 PM - Bob the Biscuit: abandon ship
12:44 PM - Bob the Biscuit left chat.
12:44 PM - Mawr: >log in
12:44 PM - Mawr: >ded
12:44 PM - Mawr: >lmao im done
12:44 PM - Coty: >/f home
12:44 PM - Coty: >what happened guys
12:44 PM - Coty: I mean its the same thing as if your base is raided
12:44 PM - Bob the Biscuit entered chat.
12:44 PM - Coty: the smart player would store their items in chests before logging out
12:44 PM - Mawr: except you dont die then and retain stuff
12:44 PM - Mawr: hmm
12:44 PM - Delay: >somebody gets killed in his sleep
12:45 PM - Coty: put your stuff in an ender chest before logging out and you'd be fine
12:45 PM - Delay: who dunnit?
12:45 PM - Coty: heh
12:45 PM - Delay: >ender chests
12:45 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >ender chests
12:45 PM - Coty: sleepers wouldn't leave death messages either
12:45 PM - Bob the Biscuit: kek
12:45 PM - Bob the Biscuit: gg nothing to gain from raiding confirmed
12:45 PM - Pip: i will make a small hidden outpost to sleep in
12:45 PM - Coty: it doesn't look like there's a plugin for sleepers but I could totally program it
12:45 PM - Mawr: um, if you want this plugin you have to disable ender chests, otherwise its pointless
12:46 PM - Coty: true
12:46 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Ender chests at all ruin raiding
12:46 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >oh boy we're being raided
12:47 PM - Mawr: well this might work
12:47 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >better start dumping EVERYTHING in enderchests
12:47 PM - Delay: here it was
12:47 PM - Delay: http://pastebin.com/HgiqmBrd
12:47 PM - Mawr: this plus no ender chests forces you to leave all your stuff in your base
12:48 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >force cooperation
12:48 PM - Mawr: and so, when your base gets rekt at 5am you lose everything :^)
12:48 PM - Mawr: nah, you can protect chunks
12:48 PM - Delay: I have a proof of concept sitting here
12:48 PM - Delay: how about sleepers + forced peace?
12:49 PM - Mawr: so basically delay
12:49 PM - Delay: hell how do I refer to your doc, rave?
12:49 PM - Mawr: what you are saying is
12:49 PM - Mawr: we need

12:51 PM - Mawr: polling for single, small concepts like this one makes no sense
12:52 PM - Delay: you can't leave decisions like that to idiots
12:52 PM - Coty: "idiots" are the ones playing lol
12:52 PM - ayy lmao entered chat.
12:52 PM - Delay: yeah
12:52 PM - Snасkу entered chat.

12:52 PM - Snасkу: the jews did 9/11
12:52 PM - D.J - Fred: AYY
12:52 PM - Mawr: you need to know other settings as well to make a proper decision
12:52 PM - Coty: I just wanted to know how people feel about it
12:52 PM - Delay: you don't trust them to make good decisions when clumped together
12:52 PM - Coty: its pretty debated, so I probably won't do it
12:52 PM - D.J - Fred:  http://cdn.steamcommunity.com/economy/emoticon/misterx  http://cdn.steamcommunity.com/economy/emoticon/misterx  http://cdn.steamcommunity.com/economy/emoticon/misterx 
12:52 PM - ayy lmao: coty that was the dumbest shit i've ever read
12:52 PM - Coty: I might still make the plugin though
12:52 PM - Snасkу left chat.
12:53 PM - Feekers left chat.
12:53 PM - Coty: I'll probably still make the plugin; but won't add it to 4craft
12:53 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV entered chat.
12:53 PM - Coty: anyways mawr you wanted variable faction protections?
12:53 PM - Coty: tl;dr it for me
12:53 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: soup
12:54 PM - Coty: I read it awhile back but don't remember much of it
12:54 PM - Mawr: The basic idea is to have different balance settings depending on the time of the day (IRL), for example:
A "wartime" period with minimal protections allowing for easy raiding.
A "peacetime" period with enhanced protections, making it practically impossible to raid.
12:54 PM - Coty: okay yeah, I programmed that into simpleFactions as an optional thing
12:54 PM - Delay: just need to automate it
12:54 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: so is this new rendition going to be like the v5 fuck around server?
12:54 PM - Zemei: wartime needs to be primetime
12:54 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Probobally not
12:55 PM - Coty: we're discussing v7 ideas right now
12:55 PM - Mawr: might wanna re-read it if you read it a while ago
12:55 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: one continent, no premade factions, less protection?
12:55 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: ah
12:55 PM - Rando entered chat.
12:55 PM - Coty: I like the idea of wartime/peacetime
12:55 PM - Mawr: i rewrote most of it
12:55 PM - Coty: But when would we do it?
12:55 PM - Coty: Weekly toggles, daily toggles?
12:55 PM - Coty: Hourly toggles?
12:55 PM - Mawr: read the doc goy
12:55 PM - Coty: nigga that shit is long
12:55 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: the fuck around server was great, bandits in groups of 3 or 5 would run around using TNT on bases, and eventually people had to be on watch. was pretty good stuff sneaking around and stuff
12:55 PM - Mawr: i tried to keep it simple
12:56 PM - Rando: 4craft v420 when?
12:56 PM - Mawr: should be able to read it quickly
12:56 PM - Coty: it's two pages of tiny text and there's 17 people in the chat
12:56 PM - Mawr: >
12:56 PM - Coty: aint got time
12:56 PM - Zemei: weekend wartime
12:56 PM - Delay: yes you do
12:56 PM - ayy lmao: remove diamond armor when
12:56 PM - Delay: just read the second page
12:56 PM - Coty: The last discussion we had (to the new guys in chat) was making people slow down with heavier armor
12:56 PM - Delay: first page is just pros and cons
12:56 PM - Mawr: It's nice because it completely solves some issues
12:56 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: weekend wartime will be interesting with all these timeznes
12:56 PM - Pip: just read the bullets
12:56 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: i like that, coty
12:57 PM - Coty: wearing leather you'd move at 1.25x speed, diamond would make you a slug
12:57 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: leather armour wont be useless, then
12:57 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: yolo
12:57 PM - ayy lmao: i can just make a script that will autoswitch armor in less then a second lmao
12:57 PM - Mawr: yeah thats a problem ayy
12:57 PM - Mawr: lamo
12:57 PM - Delay: and he can code restrictions to unequip speeds
12:57 PM - Delay: eat shit
12:57 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: have fun standing still for a split second; wow you're covered in lava
12:57 PM - Coty: what delay said
12:57 PM - Rando: pls stop coty
12:58 PM - Bob the Biscuit: I really don't like the idea of adding more autism above vannilla
12:58 PM - Coty: anyways I'm thinking peacetime/wartime could be intervals of 6 hours
12:58 PM - Coty: to cover all the timezones
12:58 PM - Gakthoil entered chat.
12:58 PM - Coty: occassionally one will be 12 hours
12:58 PM - Mawr: defeats the point goy
12:58 PM - Rando: here's an idea
12:58 PM - ayy lmao: no i want to be able to kill faggots 24/7
12:58 PM - Delay: less is more in this scenario
12:58 PM - Coty: one of yours bullet points is multiple times a day
12:58 PM - Rando: don't listen to anything coty says
12:58 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: yeah 6 hours makes it pseudo random time because of the timezones
12:58 PM - Coty: I'm reading off someone elses idea, rando
12:58 PM - Mawr: yeah, more like a side option than anything
12:58 PM - Holder Of The End entered chat.
12:59 PM - Mawr: >Proposed time setting: 2-4 hours starting at 21:00 UTC (15:00 CST)
12:59 PM - Holder Of The End: how the fuck do you connect to the server?
12:59 PM - Mawr: Is this bad?
12:59 PM - Delay: 4 hours is best
12:59 PM - Coty: server isn't going to be up until late december, holder
12:59 PM - Mawr: there is no server, starts in 4 hours
12:59 PM - Holder Of The End: shit
12:59 PM - Holder Of The End left chat.
12:59 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: owned
12:59 PM - ayy lmao: coty dont ruin the 4 hour meme scrub
12:59 PM - Coty: the problem with having it only 2-4 hours once a day
12:59 PM - Coty: is timezones
12:59 PM - Mawr: yes
12:59 PM - Mawr: >Proposed time setting: 2-4 hours starting at 21:00 UTC (15:00 CST)
12:59 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: FACK OBAMA
12:59 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: RUSSIA TIMEZONE ONLY
1:00 PM - ayy lmao: adding more shit to the server won't make it better :^)
1:00 PM - Mawr: >Some individuals might get screwed because of timezones, but factions as a whole shouldn’t. While it’s entirely possible a faction might find they are entirely from one timezone, it’s more likely they’ll be a mix of players, mostly from US/Europe with a few from SEA/Australia/NZ. This means that you should be just as equipped as other factions to be online during wartimes. In any case, you’ve got less to worry about than with default factions.
1:00 PM - Rando: hey here's an idea
1:00 PM - Mawr: You could really just read the doc :^)
1:00 PM - Azu-nyan! entered chat.
1:00 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: >letting anyone from SEA or oceania play
1:00 PM - Rando: what if we had ~~~~~~~~RUNES~~~~~~~~~~
1:00 PM - Coty: That does make sense
1:00 PM - Rando: that'll be cool r-right?
1:00 PM - Coty: I wish
1:00 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >adding more autism to minecraft
1:00 PM - Coty: rip runes
1:00 PM - Bob the Biscuit: People had fucking trouble downgrading their game version
1:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: you expect them to study up their autism for a single server
1:01 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: yes
1:01 PM - Azu-nyan!: yes
1:01 PM - Mawr: This straight-up SOLVES 1) offline raiding 2) defensive claiming 3) fire spread
1:01 PM - Delay: and you expect them to learn runes
1:01 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: this is 4craft
1:01 PM - Rando: /a/ does it
1:01 PM - Azu-nyan!: therye atustistic
1:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Not everything revolves around the giant autistic factions/boards
1:01 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: offline raiding YEAH MAYBE YOU SHOULDNT HAVE A LIFE
1:01 PM - Delay: this is a project for casuals
1:01 PM - Coty: well I programmed in a thing in simplefactions to make bases invincible if all faction members are offline for 15 minutes
1:01 PM - Mawr: nope coty
1:01 PM - Coty: so offline raiding won't be a problem
1:01 PM - Delay: so we gotta go with making things easy for casuals
1:02 PM - Mawr: Breaking into bases is easiest when the server is the least active, and he who raids bases while his opponents are asleep, wins. This is somewhat mitigated by an ‘offline protection timer’, but there is again a choice as to what the time window should be. If you set it too short, defenders could just log off as soon as trouble shows up and wait for them to go away, in confidence that enemies won’t be able to break in within the time limit. Set it too long, and you can simply wait for the last member of a faction to log off before launching an attack.
1:02 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Nah, just don't make it too autistic for the autists
1:02 PM - Delay: man, coty you might as well just read the whole thing
1:02 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: im autistic dad
1:02 PM - Coty: I am now lol
1:02 PM - Azu-nyan!: hey coty
1:02 PM - Azu-nyan!: what version of minecraft do i need to have in order to join?

1:05 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: pains in the ASS
1:05 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: they take up the good stone
1:05 PM - Coty: I love pretty much everything about the peacetime/wartime thing
1:06 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: so you gotta swap tools when you want dirt
1:06 PM - Coty: only thing I'm unsure of is the time for wartime
1:06 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: are they equal?
1:06 PM - Mawr: Yep, that's pretty much the only issue
1:06 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: is one longer  than other?
1:06 PM - Mawr: Do you have the capability to read goy
1:06 PM - Zemei: weekend primetime
1:06 PM - Azu-nyan!: wait
1:06 PM - Azu-nyan!: theres new stone now?
1:06 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: no i have dslxiya

1:06 PM - Mawr: yea
1:06 PM - Pip: 4pm cst
1:06 PM - Azu-nyan!: >peace
1:06 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: so 5 PM in the REAL part of the world

1:07 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: propose *this*
1:07 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: well ok i think it sounds alright
1:07 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: but this is all with less protection righgt
1:07 PM - Mawr: r e a d
1:07 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: but dad
1:07 PM - Coty: tl;dr you would be able to blow shit up and remove water/lava
1:07 PM - Azu-nyan!: the only kind of peace i want in this server is the kind of peace jackpot's religion is known for
1:07 PM - Coty: and possibly destroy weak blocks
1:07 PM - Coty: such as dirt/stone
1:08 PM - ayy lmao: what the fuck they added water monument autism too thanx microsoft
1:08 PM - Azu-nyan!: takbir allahu akbar
1:08 PM - Coty: but during peacetime bases would be nearly invincible

1:12 PM - Azu-nyan!: please ban reddit
1:12 PM - whateveridentity entered chat.
1:12 PM - Coty: I could make the word reddit either filter or do an auto timed ban
1:12 PM - Coty: but that's a discussion for another time
1:12 PM - Azu-nyan!: filter
1:12 PM - Delay: keep your shit together
1:12 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: filter memes; i dont like it so its bad
1:12 PM - Delay: stick to one topic of discussion until you make an almost final decision
1:13 PM - Delay: then move on
1:13 PM - Coty: well we're pretty much done with the factio ndiscussion
1:13 PM - Azu-nyan!: yeah

1:14 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: what
1:14 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: no shit
1:14 PM - Mawr: ayy
1:14 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: that idea is awful
1:14 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: then you gotta bury yourself
1:14 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: like 40 blocks under
1:14 PM - Coty: it works wonderfully in Rust
1:14 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: or stay logged in and put a paper weight on your sneak button

1:15 PM - whateveridentity: so why does the NPC have to stay there forever is my question. Make it disappear after a minute
1:15 PM - Coty: the point is to make your base extra secure
1:15 PM - ayy lmao: >implying people wont xray and see me anyways
1:15 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: why do that idea at all...?
1:15 PM - Zemei: so you have to log out somewhere safe
1:15 PM - Coty: and to play during wartime
1:15 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: 4:15 PM - ayy lmao: >implying people wont xray and see me anyways
1:15 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: there you go
1:15 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: so its settled
1:15 PM - Azu-nyan!: nigga
1:15 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: the idea is shit
1:15 PM - Azu-nyan!: tracers
1:15 PM - Azu-nyan!: esp
1:15 PM - Azu-nyan!: major nigger shit right there
1:15 PM - Zemei: during peacetime they shouldn't be able to reach you anyway
1:15 PM - Coty: traces,etc can be fixed with mods
1:16 PM - Mawr: ban azunazi for hacking!
1:16 PM - Coty: there are mods now that do simple raytraces to see if you can actually see the player
1:16 PM - Azu-nyan!: >azunazi
1:16 PM - whateveridentity: is wartime/peacetime a go?
1:16 PM - Coty: before sending you the packets saying they are there
1:16 PM - Azu-nyan!: fuck it
1:16 PM - Mawr: :^)
1:16 PM - Azu-nyan!: thats my new name
1:16 PM - Zemei: wait, really?
1:16 PM - Coty: I'd say yes, whateveridentity
1:16 PM - Zemei: awesome
1:16 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: if they cant get to you, why do NPC idea at all?
1:16 PM - ayy lmao: i remember xraying a chest deep in sand on /v/ island with full enchanted diamond gear ayy lmao
1:16 PM - whateveridentity: neat
1:16 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: who would log out OUTSIDE of wartime
1:16 PM - Mawr: muh dick
1:16 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: in fact this whole peace and war thing
1:16 PM - Mawr: >log out during wartine
1:16 PM - Mawr: >get rekt anyway
1:16 PM - Mawr: that's the idea
1:16 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: will kill 4craft faster, because people will log on only for  wartime
1:16 PM - Zemei: it encourages you to log out inside your base
1:16 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: after the first 2 days of building
1:17 PM - Mawr: which makes people log in right?
1:17 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV: the what
1:17 PM - Zemei: and also prevents players from logging outside of an enemy base
1:17 PM - Coty: all it does is centralize the times that people will play
1:17 PM - Zemei: just to log in during wartime and swarm them
1:17 PM - Delay: then the chill ones will keep building
1:17 PM - Coty: we'll have little player counts during peacetimes and spikes during wartime
1:17 PM - Mawr: 4 hours of 4craft over a month / x hours over 3 days
1:17 PM - Delay: maybe fighting each other in neutral territory
1:17 PM - ayy lmao: >log in
>o i cant kill scrubs right now
>log out
>never come back
1:17 PM - Coty: no it wouldn't do that
1:17 PM - Coty: you could still pvp
1:17 PM - Coty: just not do full raids
1:17 PM - Delay: you can still pvp
1:17 PM - Zemei: I only see one big problem though
1:17 PM - Zemei: what if the server's full during wartime and your faction can't get on?
1:18 PM - Mawr: the big problem are timezones
1:18 PM - Azunazi!: what do you mean not full raids?
1:18 PM - Coty: meaning you can't tnt bases, etc, during peacetime
1:18 PM - Pip: server will be 10,000 slots just give coty your money
1:18 PM - Mawr: gotta get a bigger server
1:18 PM - Delay: you can't break blocks, pretty much
1:18 PM - Coty: so wartime makes it much easier to raid
1:18 PM - Delay: no way to break blocks in peace time, wartime makes it easier to break blocks
1:18 PM - Delay: you dig?
1:18 PM - Zemei: peacetime will basically be how bases historically were
1:18 PM - Mawr: more secure zemei
1:18 PM - Zemei: impenetrable
1:19 PM - Mawr: more-or less
1:19 PM - Zemei: no, they were always basically invincible
1:19 PM - Pip: heh so /a/ will still raid during peace time
1:19 PM - Zemei: you can't get more secure than an underwater autism cube
1:19 PM - Delay: but they can't
1:19 PM - Zealous: http://4craftv7.buycraft.net/
1:19 PM - Delay: unless you let them in your base to rape you
1:19 PM - Mawr: no they werent zemei
1:19 PM - Zemei: /a/ could only raid factions who don't know how to build
1:19 PM - Mawr: clearly you've never been 5am raided :^)
1:20 PM - ayy lmao: pip how much times did coty suck ur cock for that money
1:20 PM - Zemei: how would you have gotten in?
1:20 PM - Delay: if we use obsidian breaker to increase block tnt resist by a bit
1:20 PM - Mawr: so every faction zemei?
1:20 PM - Delay: we can disable water blast resist
1:20 PM - whateveridentity: timezones wouldn't be as big of an issue if the periods are a matter of days instead of hours. way back I suggested a 5 day on/off cycle, but another cat recently broke it down into something like a 5 hour on/off cycle. Both have their advantages
1:20 PM - Zemei: in v6, most active factions had their stashes in invincible autism cubes
1:21 PM - Mawr: i bet you consider pol's base invincible
1:21 PM - Mawr: topkek
1:21 PM - Coty: wartime could make all blocks breakable if we wanted (but keep protected blocks super strong)
1:21 PM - Mawr: it's called a hybrid cannon btw
1:21 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >tfw we had ours in a superior bedrock fortress under the tallest mountain
1:21 PM - Zemei: everyone could have logged out
1:21 PM - Zemei: before you had time to break through
1:21 PM - Delay: we can do a lot of things for wartime
1:22 PM - Coty: offline protection won't be valid during wartime
1:22 PM - Azunazi!: >tfw /a/ had a hell fortress
1:22 PM - Mawr: yeap that would be a problem that peacetime/wartime completely solves
1:22 PM - Zemei: I was just making a point that peacetime will be the equivalent of v6 all the time
1:22 PM - Zemei: so wartime is good
1:22 PM - Delay: so we go with it
1:22 PM - Mawr: but the protections would be greater than in v6 goy
1:22 PM - Pip: do it
1:22 PM - Delay: decided
1:22 PM - Azunazi!: why split peacetime and wartime?
1:23 PM - Delay: coty final say
1:23 PM - Zemei: not significantly, no
1:23 PM - Pip: wartime peace time confirmed
1:23 PM - ayy lmao: why not have wartime all the time :^)
1:23 PM - Mawr: >can blow shit up vs cant
1:23 PM - Azunazi!: oh jesus no i just wanna wreck some bases
1:23 PM - Zemei: you just had to make a base that would take hybrid cannons hours to bust through
1:23 PM - Coty: I'm going to say it's confirmed when I finish programming it
1:23 PM - Zemei: and log out when it starts happening
1:23 PM - Delay: well confirmed planned
1:23 PM - Delay: there we go
1:23 PM - Azunazi!: i hope that shit works coty
1:23 PM - Zemei: that's how /out/'s base was
1:23 PM - Delay: read the doc if you have questions
1:23 PM - Delay: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzKd-DJ_Jg0LofEGVxH_IGtKvEtFDTLrCG02Eygf3aY/
1:23 PM - Zemei: obsidian everywhere
1:24 PM - Pip: now to decide on intervals
1:24 PM - ayy lmao: when i went to /out/ there was only a fucking hut and a field
1:24 PM - Zemei: it was underground
1:24 PM - Zemei: we had cozy cabins and shit above
1:24 PM - ayy lmao: i was just passing out and guy fucking logged in exactly when i was scavanging chests
1:24 PM - Zemei: also there was no field, our island was a huge mountain
1:25 PM - Pip: when you announce peacetime/wartime make sure you meantion peace time is exactly like all 4crafts
1:25 PM - Pip: it makes it sound a lot better
1:25 PM - Pip: you can still be raided during peacetime if you dont build
1:25 PM - Pip: warmed me up to the idea
1:25 PM - Delay: but it isn't
1:25 PM - Pip: i thought it was
1:26 PM - Delay: it's "offline protection"
1:26 PM - Delay: on at all times
1:26 PM - Delay: that's peace time
1:26 PM - Pip: blocks cant be destroyed?
1:26 PM - Delay: not at all
1:26 PM - Pip: ey
1:26 PM - Delay: until the 4 hour wartime
1:26 PM - Delay: then they get massively reduced protections
1:26 PM - Coty: http://strawpoll.me/3099088/
1:26 PM - Delay: or just reduced
1:27 PM - Kaiki Mk. IV left chat.
1:27 PM - ayy lmao: pls include a command that will tell us how much longer till wartime
1:27 PM - Zemei: it's still very much close to how v6 was
1:27 PM - Delay: fucking
1:27 PM - Delay: strawpoll
1:27 PM - Delay: why
1:27 PM - Coty: I want to know the general population's thoughts
1:27 PM - Coty: its a quick way
1:27 PM - Delay: are you really not slime?
1:27 PM - Coty: wat
1:27 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >no "fuck off coty" option
1:27 PM - Delay: it's the exact same shit he said
1:27 PM - Drshitshow entered chat.
1:27 PM - Coty: probably because that's what I told her
1:28 PM - Delay: the majority is uninformed
1:28 PM - Delay: and are incredibly selfish
1:28 PM - Drshitshow: There isn't an option for no...
1:28 PM - Delay: because of that
1:28 PM - Coty: it's already decided that we're doing it dr, I just want to know what times people want most
1:28 PM - Delay: they go straight to what they believe is in their best interest
1:28 PM - Zemei: I second strawpoll being worthless
1:29 PM - Zealous: ^
1:29 PM - Delay: and it's all fucked up
1:29 PM - Coty: the most voted thing so far is "Wartime during the weekends (Friday afternoon - Sunday night), Peacetime during the week."
1:29 PM - Coty: what are your guys' thoughts on that?
1:29 PM - Delay: this is why game devs don't let fans vote on gameplay mechanics
1:29 PM - Zemei: http://puu.sh/d4ENd/5e2027560d.png this was literally the whole island
1:29 PM - Delay: people in general are a bunch of idiots
1:29 PM - Zemei: I voted for wartime during the weekends
1:29 PM - Zemei: it's most sensible
1:30 PM - ayy lmao: server will be dead before first weekend lmao
1:30 PM - Azunazi!: same
1:30 PM - Coty: my only concern with weekends is yes; server might be ded
1:30 PM - Zealous: can you just have it turned on for like 4-5 hours during the weekends instead then
1:30 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN entered chat.
1:30 PM - Pip: i work all days of the week but at least weekend vote is a 48 hour period so i will have a chance
1:30 PM - Zemei: I think the buildup before wartime would keep the server alive
1:30 PM - whateveridentity: I think 3-5 days between each switch from peace to war is the sweet spot. Gives people enough times to recuperate from raids as well as work on plans for new raids and plans for the next wartime, or work on peaceful projects
1:30 PM - Delay: it's when you start talking to a group of informed people who understand and can consider the different ideas
1:30 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: >no week play
1:30 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: so
1:30 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: just take server down
1:30 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: except for weekends
1:30 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: you guys are retards
1:31 PM - Delay: see?
1:31 PM - Coty: wat
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: although
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: you can ERP all week i suppose
1:31 PM - Delay: reactionary
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: no you're retarded
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: firstly delay you are definately retarded
1:31 PM - Coty: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzKd-DJ_Jg0LofEGVxH_IGtKvEtFDTLrCG02Eygf3aY/ glance over this
1:31 PM - Delay: everyone's retarded
1:31 PM - Coty: the second page really
1:31 PM - Coty: you can still pvp, just not raid
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: what pvp
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: was there
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: in 4craft
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: except raiding
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: m8
1:31 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: come at me
1:32 PM - Delay: man, fuck strawpolls
1:32 PM - Zemei: during the week the emphasis is on gathering resources
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: why didnt you just vote yes or no
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: on what the poll said
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: dude
1:32 PM - Zemei: there are a limited amount of resources
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: everyone could always gatehr resources
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: all the time
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: people just qui
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: when they lost
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: your changes have no effect on this
1:32 PM - Coty: the weekdays of peace would give them time to regroup
1:32 PM - Coty: and rebuild
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: nah it wouldnt
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: they could literally do that
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: anyway
1:32 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: they just left because they lost
1:32 PM - Zealous: I just see everyone having smurfs with their stuff on during war time.
1:32 PM - Delay: they don't need 5 days for that shit
1:33 PM - Coty: not really, not when another faction could just rape you while you're building
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: why didnt you just vote yes or no
1:33 PM - Zealous: and then just logging off with it
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: on what the doc said
1:33 PM - Zemei: Zealous, did you listen earlier
1:33 PM - Delay: you can only wreck a faction so much in 4 hours
1:33 PM - whateveridentity: wartime on weekends might leave too much time between wartimes. People play a weekend and forget about it by the next. But it would align with player spikes better
1:33 PM - Zemei: if you log out you're still there
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: why did you not just vote
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: yes or no on what the doc said
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: the entire idea
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: was so that you couldnt crack a base
1:33 PM - Coty: because we already decided yes
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: when they were all offline
1:33 PM - Coty: on the entire idea
1:33 PM - Delay: because it's decided on
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: so whats stopping them just doing that
1:33 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: on friday or saturday or sunday night
1:33 PM - Zemei: people will be online on the weekend
1:34 PM - Delay: I hope you're regretting this, coty
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: they really wont m8
1:34 PM - Coty: yeah, people stay up all night
1:34 PM - Coty: on weekends
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: there are times on the weekend
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: hahaha
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: so we have to stay up all night
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: every weekend
1:34 PM - Zealous: if it's on weekends pleae don't make it 24 hours
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: dude you are retarded
1:34 PM - Coty: no, just have players from different timezones
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: the serber will only be alive for 2-3 weeks at most
1:34 PM - Mawr: people wont be online for 48 hours m8
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: so we have
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: 2 weekends
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: on which to actually play
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: hahaha
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: it was alive for 3 days last time
1:34 PM - Coty: dude are you 12
1:34 PM - Coty: serious question
1:34 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: no you're fucking delusional
1:34 PM - Delay: regret
1:34 PM - Coty: like your name and the way you type
1:35 PM - whateveridentity: I don't think the implication is that people are expected to play for 48 hours straight during the wartime
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and you dont' even know your own server
1:35 PM - Delay: and he's entirely focused on the weekend thing
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: or the stats of it
1:35 PM - Zealous: I KNOW BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE LISTEN TO MEEE
1:35 PM - Mawr: kinda is indentiy
1:35 PM - Zemei: which board are you with, /b/?
1:35 PM - Delay: when it's the worst choice on the list
1:35 PM - Mawr: cause if you dont
1:35 PM - Delay: actually, second worst
1:35 PM - Mawr: you'll randomly get raided in the middle of the night
1:35 PM - Mawr: fun, right?
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: the doc
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: already had
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: a time
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: period
1:35 PM - Zemei: I do think the weekend should have more wartime than usual at least
1:35 PM - Mawr: 20 attackers vs 2 defenders
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: which was smart
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: prime time
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: every day
1:35 PM - Coty: We could always enable offline protection during wartime; if we made wartime an extended period
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: offline protection
1:35 PM - Mawr: ayy lmao
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: is stupid
1:35 PM - Coty: but if it isn't an extended period, offline protections would be disabled
1:35 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: thats why the doc was made
1:36 PM - Coty: in the case of once a day for a few hours
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: because people just mass log
1:36 PM - Coty: dude what
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: when they think they are in a bad position
1:36 PM - Coty: offline protections kick in 15 minutes after everyone is offline
1:36 PM - Zemei: there's a timer before it kicks in
1:36 PM - Coty: that's enough time to rekt their shit
1:36 PM - Delay: not satisfied with just "we're doing this, we're using prime time"
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: 15 minutes
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: is not long
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: play the game
1:36 PM - Coty: so you're complaining about time, not the concept
1:36 PM - Delay: no we have to hear what everyone else thinks even if it doesn't matter
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: no
1:36 PM - Coty: it oculd be increased by an hour
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: the concept is stupid
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: it never works
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its either too much
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: or too little
1:36 PM - Coty: except it does
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and it is only there to be gamed
1:36 PM - Coty: and you're just spewing diarhea from your mouth with zero forethought
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: because a normal faction will always have 1-2 players online off peak
1:36 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: no
1:37 PM - whateveridentity: What constitutes "primetime" when there are players from the states, britbong, europe, etc?
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and if they are a tryhard
1:37 PM - Mawr: >diarhea
1:37 PM - Coty: Primtime, I'd go off of what Steam says is primetime
1:37 PM - Mawr: >every time
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: they will just log off when they dont want to get rekt
1:37 PM - Zemei: it has to be a long stretch of time if you say primetime
1:37 PM - whateveridentity: That's the issue with having it fixed at a certain hour span every day
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and when they aren't tryharding
1:37 PM - Mawr: >Proposed time setting: 2-4 hours starting at 21:00 UTC (15:00 CST)
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: they will have 1 or 2 guys
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: out of base mining or building
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and so be easily destroyed
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: so your entire idea
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: is actually a hinderance
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: not a help
1:37 PM - Coty: so what is your proposal?
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: just follow what the doc says
1:37 PM - Zemei: tell your faggots to log off then
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: because rave is smart
1:37 PM - Mawr: >Proposed Wartime time setting: 2-4 hours starting at 21:00 UTC (15:00 CST)
1:37 PM - Coty: holy shit are you /a/
1:37 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: >tell people not to play the game
1:38 PM - Coty: I'm diyng
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: >this helps the server
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: youre a retard
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: like
1:38 PM - Coty: I don't understand you. You first complained that the whole faction protection idea is shit
1:38 PM - StruttingB4: wartimes are dumb
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: I dont even have to twist your words
1:38 PM - Coty: and now you're saying to follow it
1:38 PM - StruttingB4: they are just going to be anoying as fuck
1:38 PM - Coty: like what
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its good because
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: it cant be gamed
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: it is just a prime time
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: for like 4 hours
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: when most eople are playing
1:38 PM - Delay: "We have to know what everyone else thinks before we decide on something"
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and its not just 2 days
1:38 PM - Coty: so your whole complaint
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: of a weekend
1:38 PM - Coty: is that you don't want the weekend
1:38 PM - Coty: you want it once a day
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: because
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its the entire weekend
1:38 PM - Coty: you could have just said that
1:38 PM - Zemei: the alternative to not having wartimes is having another turtlefest
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: all weekend
1:38 PM - Coty: and not shit up the chat
1:38 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its stupid
1:38 PM - Delay: This argument is a waste of time
1:39 PM - Coty: holy shit
1:39 PM - Coty: kill yourself
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its the worst of both worlds
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: haha
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: you have no argument
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: so you just spew bullshit
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: yeah
1:39 PM - Coty: because there IS no argument
1:39 PM - Coty: I asked what time is best
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: prime time
1:39 PM - Zemei: and could you maybe condense what you have to say into one or two lines?
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: every day
1:39 PM - Coty: and you're acting like I already decided the weekend
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: not
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: entire weekend
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: because
1:39 PM - Zemei: instead
1:39 PM - Zemei: of talking
1:39 PM - Zemei: like
1:39 PM - Zemei: this
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: that doesnt solve the problem
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: since its the entire weekend
1:39 PM - Coty: okay so
1:39 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: people can still raid when everyone is asleep etc
1:39 PM - Coty: you want once a day, not weekends
1:39 PM - Coty: just say that
1:39 PM - Coty: and fuck off
1:40 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: im saying follow the doc
1:40 PM - Delay: I hate strawpolls
1:40 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and play primetime every day
1:40 PM - Mawr: >polls
1:40 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: as the doc says
1:40 PM - ayy lmao: YOUR PRIMETIME ISN'T MY PRIMETIME
1:40 PM - Coty: lmao
1:40 PM - Bob the Biscuit: What timezone is your waifu?
1:40 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its the average prime time
1:40 PM - Coty: din do nuffin, I'd like you to know I actually voted for the 15:00 CST option
1:40 PM - StruttingB4: reading the duck atm
1:40 PM - StruttingB4: lets see if it changes my mind
1:40 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: great
1:40 PM - Coty: so all of your arguing hasn't done a thing
1:40 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: well done
1:41 PM - ayy lmao: 8PM CEST IS PRIME TIME
1:41 PM - Mawr: My primetime is when my boypussy is getting fingered by my boyfriend~
1:41 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: but you still made the poll
1:41 PM - StruttingB4: thanks
1:41 PM - Coty: because that was my stance in the beginning
1:41 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: with hilarious options
1:41 PM - StruttingB4: proud of myself
1:41 PM - Coty: anyways
1:41 PM - Coty: what is the next topic
1:41 PM - Delay: People get the wrong idea when you announce a strawpoll to know "what the players think" they think that whatever wins is what will happen
1:41 PM - Mawr: ^^^
1:42 PM - Mawr: >polls
1:42 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: then why even poll
1:42 PM - Coty: I got what I needed from the strawpoll itself
1:42 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: because people are retarded
1:42 PM - Mawr: ^^^
1:42 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: that's what you'll find out
1:42 PM - Mawr: >polls
1:42 PM - Coty: muh democracy
1:42 PM - Delay: next topic there is no excuse for using a strawpoll for anything that matters
1:42 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its not a democracy its a serber
1:42 PM - Coty: strawpolls aren't final decision makers
1:42 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: if you treat it like a democracy it will get shit up
1:42 PM - Coty: they are just go aid in understanding what people want
1:42 PM - Delay: the people voting don't know that
1:43 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: but in terms of 4craft its been shown time and again taht people don't know what they want
1:43 PM - Coty: they don't have to know that
1:43 PM - Mawr: 21:43 - DIN DO NUFFIN: but in terms of 4craft its been shown time and again taht people don't know what they want
1:43 PM - Mawr: +420
1:43 PM - Coty: I've never gone entirely off of what strawpolls have said
1:43 PM - Delay: >they don't have to know that
1:43 PM - Coty: They don't have to know that because the majority don't give a shit
1:43 PM - Pip: let v7 be experimental
1:43 PM - Delay: and then you breed dissent by telling them their input doesn't matter
1:43 PM - Pip: if people dont like it v8 can go back to normal
1:43 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: every version has been experimental
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: m8
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: different stuff has been tried every time
1:44 PM - Zemei: because nothing has really 'worked'
1:44 PM - Pip: the times i played it was just factions
1:44 PM - StruttingB4: read the duck
1:44 PM - StruttingB4: still don't like the idea
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: thats because people play for board identity
1:44 PM - Delay: Just post proper announcements instead of strawpolls that don't matter
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and to play with a board
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: that leaves very little in terms of plugins
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: you have like factions or towny
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and towny was played before
1:44 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and it was awful
1:45 PM - StruttingB4 is now playing Garry's Mod. Click here to join.
1:45 PM - Coty: when you post a discussion based announcement you only get a few replies with a side of "fuck off," when you post a strawpoll you get the populace's general opinion. It's kind of like how in America everyone "votes for the president" even though their votes mean jack shit
1:45 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: edge
1:45 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: lord
1:45 PM - Coty: instead you have an electoral college who votes for the people, instead of the votes for people actually mattering
1:45 PM - Coty: dude what
1:45 PM - Coty: it's facts
1:46 PM - Coty: we here in the discussion chat are acting as the electoral college
1:46 PM - Coty: with the strawpoll simply telling us what the general population thinks
1:46 PM - Coty: yeah they'll be uninformed but their opinion still /matters/
1:46 PM - whateveridentity: don't forget the ebin memeposting; announcements always have healthy quantities
1:46 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: but this isnt a democracy
1:46 PM - StruttingB4 is now playing Garry's Mod. Click here to join.
1:46 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: or a country
1:46 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its a server
1:46 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: as a result
1:46 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: you cant apply the same ideas
1:46 PM - Coty: this is a community project, and every single person has a voice that deserves to be heard
1:47 PM - Mawr: lel
1:47 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its like voting on science
1:47 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its a minecraft server
1:47 PM - Coty: minecraft isnt science though
1:47 PM - Coty: its a video game
1:47 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: as a result there are things that do or dont work
1:47 PM - Coty: we're voting on fun
1:47 PM - Mawr: That's why you make an actual thread where you present your point in detail.
1:47 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its like voting on game balance
1:47 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >fun
1:47 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: there are people who don't know about game mechanics
1:47 PM - Mawr: So people can actually take a while to think and respond
1:47 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: therefore their opinions are useless on the matter
1:47 PM - Coty: which is why we don't take the strawpolls super seriously
1:48 PM - Coty: 3:46 PM - Coty: yeah they'll be uninformed but their opinion still /matters/
1:48 PM - Zemei: people who balance games listen to the general playerbase for input, and while they don't go with the majority's opinion
1:48 PM - whateveridentity: >arguing the benefits of varying forms of representative government, either democratic or totalitarian
1:48 PM - Zemei: they still listen
1:48 PM - Mawr: Which gives you a lot of differing opinions on the matter
1:48 PM - Coty: zemei gets it
1:48 PM - whateveridentity: >in my 4craft chat?
1:48 PM - Mawr: Which in turn helps you decide
1:48 PM - Coty: yeah, they help us decide
1:48 PM - whateveridentity: >you would be surprised
1:48 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: most of the people
1:48 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: dont play minecraft
1:48 PM - Coty: I'm not deciding based on strawpolls
1:48 PM - Mawr: As opposed to >polls or >le steam chat
1:48 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: who play 4craft
1:48 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: just sayin
1:48 PM - Mawr: Where you cant hold a discussion
1:48 PM - Mawr: for shit
1:48 PM - Delay: but they do that kind of balance after they have something set up
1:49 PM - Coty: which is why we still hold a discussion here
1:49 PM - Coty: even with posting strawpolls
1:49 PM - Delay: they never pull that shit when they actually make the feature
1:49 PM - harbl entered chat.
1:49 PM - Coty: anyways let's get back to server discussion
1:49 PM - harbl: ayy lmao
1:50 PM - Delay: before that
1:50 PM - Delay: What has been decided so far
1:50 PM - harbl: Hey guys
1:50 PM - Pip: no sleepers
1:50 PM - Delay: for documentation
1:50 PM - harbl: what's your favorite color of wallet
1:50 PM - harbl: mine is green
1:50 PM - Zemei: I can see how hardcore raiding factions wouldn't like extended periods of peace, but 4craft shouldn't be catering exclusively to bloodthirsty players
1:50 PM - Delay: Coty's word is law
1:50 PM - Drshitshow: mine is blue
1:50 PM - whateveridentity: tan
1:50 PM - Delay: shut up
1:50 PM - Drshitshow: No bully
1:50 PM - harbl: tan a shit
1:50 PM - Zemei: especially since they always leave after their raid on /a/ fails
1:50 PM - Zealous: sadly we voted for some kind of wartime thing which sounds good as a idea but in fucking action /a/ is just going to wreck everyone even quicker
1:50 PM - harbl: guys we can all agree black is normalfag tier
1:51 PM - harbl: right
1:51 PM - whateveridentity: rude
1:51 PM - harbl: surely you dont have a black wallet right
1:51 PM - harbl: right??
1:51 PM - Zealous: argue with it all you want but it's true
1:51 PM - Drshitshow: N-no
1:51 PM - Delay: Coty, what's the current decision on Variable faction protections?
1:51 PM - harbl: only plebs have black wallets
1:51 PM - harbl: Green cozy as fuck
1:51 PM - Delay: before we move on
1:51 PM - harbl: orange is for attentionwhore faggots
1:51 PM - SalientGreen entered chat.
1:51 PM - Coty: Variable faction protections (eg wartimes) are a yes. When they are happening can still be discussed but I'm personally leaning towards the original proposal, which is prime time once a day for a few hours.
1:51 PM - Mawr: how so Zelaous?
1:51 PM - Zemei: thoughts on dark purple
1:52 PM - harbl: Salient what's your favorite color of wallet
1:52 PM - Delay: ok
1:52 PM - whateveridentity: agreed
1:52 PM - SalientGreen: black harbl.
1:52 PM - Coty: I'd like to hear reasining as to why people would want other wartimes
1:52 PM - SalientGreen: it's simple
1:52 PM - harbl: fukcing
1:52 PM - harbl: faggot
1:52 PM - mice: which faction will suffer from the doc the most?
1:52 PM - harbl: ban salient
1:52 PM - Coty: reasoning*
1:52 PM - harbl: ban
1:52 PM - harbl: fucking normalfag wallets here
1:52 PM - Coty: tiny factions will suffer the most during wartime
1:52 PM - SalientGreen: haha
1:52 PM - Mawr: It's arguably easier to defend when a raid could only happen during 4 hours every day
1:52 PM - SalientGreen: as always
1:52 PM - Zemei: I like once a day for a few hours, with extended wartime on the weekends
1:52 PM - Coty: mawr is right on that
1:52 PM - harbl: I bet coty has a black wallet
1:52 PM - SalientGreen: the small factions always get fucked by admin decisions
1:52 PM - Coty: extended wartimes on weekends is a good idea
1:53 PM - whateveridentity: Longer periods of wartime and peacetime allow for players to recuperate lost materials and work on projects that would otherwise be disrupted
1:53 PM - Coty: and yes my wallet is black
1:53 PM - SalientGreen: I know this. been in like 4 of the damn things.
1:53 PM - harbl: WOW
1:53 PM - Drshitshow: I have to agree with Zealous though, however I think it also hurts diplomacy, whats the point of making alliance and trusting in other factions for the unexpected when its on set times
1:53 PM - harbl: BLACK WALLET
1:53 PM - harbl: FUCKING FAGGOT
1:53 PM - Zemei: small faction leader here, bring it on
1:53 PM - Delay: http://puu.sh/dbYF1/1f83c0f645.png
1:53 PM - harbl: DROPPED
1:53 PM - harbl: 4CRAFT
1:53 PM - harbl: DROPPED
1:53 PM - Coty: pls
1:53 PM - Mawr: identity, disrupted for 4 hours goy
1:53 PM - Delay: I'll throw that on the thread
1:53 PM - whateveridentity: They also cater to all players regardless of timezone
1:53 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: whats the point in allying when you can just be raided when you are all offline m8?
1:53 PM - Rando: meh
1:53 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: who allied for the unexpected anyway
1:53 PM - harbl: GIVE ME ADMIN SO I CAN BAN ALL BLACK WALLETS PLEASE
1:53 PM - harbl: PLEASE
1:53 PM - Rando: the wartime thing doesn't seem that bad actually
1:53 PM - SalientGreen: also what's this I hear djinra's a mod?
1:53 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: when was a faction ever saved by an alliance when there was an unexpected attack
1:53 PM - harbl: WOW
1:53 PM - Coty: How about this guys. Four hours of raiding time once a day around prime time. On weekends there are 8 hour raiding periods on each day.
1:53 PM - harbl: DROPPED
1:53 PM - harbl left chat.
1:54 PM - SalientGreen: or we could go with citadel protections
1:54 PM - Zemei: their alliance gave them shelter and helped them recover?
1:54 PM - Delay: https://8chan.co/4craft/res/404.html#410
1:54 PM - SalientGreen: so small factions don't get fucked by /a/ instantly
1:54 PM - Coty: I wrote an entire plugin for 4craft v7, salientgreen
1:54 PM - Drshitshow: or we could go with citadel protections
1:54 PM - SalientGreen: like they did in v6
1:54 PM - Coty: entire factions plugin
1:54 PM - Drshitshow: 3d claiming?
1:54 PM - Mawr: 8 hours sounds like a long time
1:54 PM - SalientGreen: 3d protections are retarted
1:54 PM - Coty: so we can literally do whatever we want with it
1:54 PM - whateveridentity: meh, 4 hours seems too short. We could do something different for weekends, but that makes the schedule overly complicated
1:54 PM - Delay: LET'S MOVE ON
1:54 PM - Drshitshow: NO
1:54 PM - SalientGreen: lets not
1:54 PM - Coty: we'll get to 3d claiming later
1:54 PM - Coty: still on time
1:54 PM - Coty: for warzones
1:54 PM - Coty: wartime*
1:55 PM - Pip: i dont object to 4 hours a day
1:55 PM - SalientGreen: seems unworkable.
1:55 PM - whateveridentity: if the periods are days at a time instead of hours, its easier for all players to know when is what
1:55 PM - Delay: 4 hour prime time on weekdays, +1/+2 hours on friday and saturday
1:55 PM - Coty: it would be at 15:00 CST
1:55 PM - Coty: each day
1:55 PM - SalientGreen: except regional players might get fukt
1:55 PM - Mid entered chat.
1:56 PM - SalientGreen: what about europoors?#
1:56 PM - Delay: if +2 it'll start one hour earlier and end 1 hour later
1:56 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: it was made by a europoor
1:56 PM - Mid: i decided to play the superior civcraft :^)
1:56 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: so imagine its at a friendly time
1:56 PM - Coty: there aren't enough european players to justify moving the time anywhere else
1:56 PM - Kazuhira Miller entered chat.
1:56 PM - Coty: the server is typically US based
1:56 PM - Coty: so we don't get a ton of europeans
1:56 PM - SalientGreen: you know that's bullshit right
1:56 PM - ayy lmao: fuck off burgers
1:56 PM - SalientGreen: I've seen so many bongistaners
1:56 PM - whateveridentity: it allows more time for plans and gameplay to gather momentum. Change it by the hour, and people will get tripped up. "Oh wait, peactime started at 6:30, not 7?" "This is too confusing" etc
1:56 PM - SalientGreen: myself included.
1:57 PM - Delay: because you play in bongistani time, idiot
1:57 PM - Coty: I know its facts because I have the IPs of everyone who's ever connected to 4craft
1:57 PM - Kazuhira Miller: >Two-thousand and eleven with three more years added in the year of our lord
1:57 PM - Kazuhira Miller: >Not partaking in Civcraft
1:57 PM - Pip: coty working for fbi confirmed
1:57 PM - Kazuhira Miller: >Partaking in 4craft
1:57 PM - Coty: at least to v1 beta, v3, v4, and v6
1:57 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: civcraft is shit
1:57 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: m8
1:57 PM - SalientGreen: block protection needs to be a thing too
1:57 PM - Kazuhira Miller: and yet it's better than 4craft

1:57 PM - SalientGreen: else everyone who is not /a/ will die
1:57 PM - Archevei: ^
1:57 PM - Archevei: this
1:57 PM - Archevei: don't even play 4craft
1:57 PM - D.J - Fred: ayy
1:58 PM - Mid: "ITS NORMAL FOR 4CRAFT TO BE DONE IN ITERATIONS"
1:58 PM - Mawr: protip: the big raid against /a/ in v5 was ~3h long
1:58 PM - ayy lmao: you do know /n/iggers won last 4craft
1:58 PM - Coty: it is normal for 4craft to be based on iterations
1:58 PM - Mid: "ITS COMPLETELY FINE FOR IT TO DIE AND KEEP COMING BACK THATS JUST HOW 4CRAFT WORKS GUYS"
1:58 PM - Kazuhira Miller: also Civcraft has been up for years. 4craft lasts for two weeks at best every few months.
1:58 PM - Coty: its what I set out to do from the beginning
1:58 PM - Drshitshow: >Implying implications
1:58 PM - ayy lmao: /n/ killed enderdragon therefore we won
1:58 PM - Coty: I personally never wnated 4craft to be 2b2t-like
1:58 PM - Drshitshow: Kek
1:58 PM - whateveridentity: Another advantage of periods lasting multiple days is that gameplay is less predictable
1:58 PM - SalientGreen: I personally didn't want /a/ being overpowered to shit
1:58 PM - Kazuhira Miller: what's the point of diplomacy and building stuff if it's all over in two weeks?
1:58 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Comparing civcraft and 4craft is like comparing apples to bananas
1:58 PM - SalientGreen: sadly that's what we go
1:58 PM - SalientGreen: t
1:58 PM - Delay: Stop talking about how the idea might be good, we know it's good, it has been decided that it'll be used. 
The primetime suggestion in the doc is also at the most optimal. I don't see anything left to discuss other than weekend time.
1:58 PM - Bob the Biscuit: completely diffrent shit
1:59 PM - whateveridentity: if its for a few hours, everyone logs on and stays put anticipating a raid
1:59 PM - Coty: its two weeks of FUN
1:59 PM - Mawr: How is /a/ overpowered?
1:59 PM - SalientGreen: it's two weeks of autism
1:59 PM - SalientGreen: autism cubes
1:59 PM - Kazuhira Miller: "we know it's good"
1:59 PM - whateveridentity: a stalemate is created
1:59 PM - Kazuhira Miller: topkek
1:59 PM - SalientGreen: and losing everything
1:59 PM - SalientGreen: unless you're /a/ or /tg/
1:59 PM - Bob the Biscuit: 4craft sets people into maximum autism mode for solid weeks
1:59 PM - Coty: then don't play if it's not fun for you?
1:59 PM - Bob the Biscuit: people would burn out in civcraft
1:59 PM - Coty: ^
1:59 PM - SalientGreen: it's not fun because there is no balance
1:59 PM - Mid: civcraft is a good kind of autism
1:59 PM - Kazuhira Miller: but they burn out in 4craft even sooner
1:59 PM - Mawr: > i am bad at game and dont want to get better
1:59 PM - SalientGreen: /a/ wins nothing else changes
1:59 PM - Mawr: >cater to me
1:59 PM - Coty: well that's why we are discussing balance right now
1:59 PM - Mid: as in weeaboo shitheads dont fuck the shit out of the metagame
2:00 PM - Mawr: Because it's so hard to learn from your mistakes right
2:00 PM - SalientGreen: are you done sucking djinra's cock mawr?
2:00 PM - Bob the Biscuit: If people went in cuvcraft whaty would happen is tons of autism cubes would be made
2:00 PM - Mawr: le
2:00 PM - ayy lmao: x d
2:00 PM - Bob the Biscuit: then everyone gets bored and leaves, or attacks random towns until pearled
2:00 PM - Coty: has anyone even seen djinra since discussion started?
2:00 PM - Kazuhira Miller: but Bob that's what happens in 4craft
2:00 PM - Drshitshow: But the tism cubes would be fine to break
2:00 PM - harbl entered chat.
2:00 PM - Delay: Mid the only reason /a/ isn't ruining civcraft for everyone right now is because they don't feel like it
2:00 PM - SalientGreen: seriously the same thing happens every damn time.
2:00 PM - harbl: mods sticky this shit http://steamcommunity.com/groups/implyingyourgroupisbetter/discussions/0/617320628302515020/
2:00 PM - Coty: pls stop spam
2:00 PM - SalientGreen: /a/ comes along fucks with everyone, no one can resist,
2:00 PM - Coty: kthnx
2:00 PM - SalientGreen: server dies
2:00 PM - Kazuhira Miller: also autism cubes would just get broken in Civcraft
2:00 PM - SalientGreen: rinse and repeat
2:00 PM - Coty: did you not see what happened v6?
2:00 PM - Mawr: Why can't they resist goy
2:00 PM - Coty: or was that v5?
2:00 PM - harbl: im not spamming this is legit discussion
2:01 PM - Coty: bob link the video
2:01 PM - harbl: now sticky
2:01 PM - Gakthoil disconnected.
2:01 PM - Zealous: how about wartime is the only time you can go through enderportal, too?
2:01 PM - SalientGreen: oh I dunno maybe because /a/ literally meta's and exploits like bitches
2:01 PM - Mawr: You are making it sound like /a/ is getting free bedrock, potions, etc
2:01 PM - Mid: remove nether
2:01 PM - whateveridentity: secretly I also want multiple day periods so that during peacetime, every midnight the server can send out a message tolling out THE FIRST DAY THE SECOND DAY counting down to wartime, ala Majora's Mask
2:01 PM - SalientGreen: then use hax when they start to lose
2:01 PM - Mawr: nice buzzwords
2:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2nQoNuT6eA
2:01 PM - SalientGreen: like against /tv/
2:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: "no one is having fun"
2:01 PM - Mawr: here we go, the hackusations
2:01 PM - Coty: salient watch that video
2:01 PM - whateveridentity: shit would be fun as fuck
2:01 PM - SalientGreen: remember /tv/ guys.
2:01 PM - harbl: what walllet does dijinra have
2:01 PM - Delay: Whatever's idea is nice
2:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Having /a/ be faggots actually united the entire server
2:01 PM - Mawr: >/a/'s been hacking for how many literations now? 6?
2:01 PM - harbl: I bet he has a red one
2:01 PM - Kazuhira Miller: HEY
2:01 PM - Kazuhira Miller: I HELPED LEAD THAT RAID
2:02 PM - whateveridentity: never forget SalientGreen
2:02 PM - Kazuhira Miller: IT SUCKED BALLS
2:02 PM - Mawr: >0 evidence of hacks
2:02 PM - Kazuhira Miller: THERE WAS N OFUN
2:02 PM - Coty: when one faction gets to big; 4craft has proven they can put differences aside and work together to take down the mega faction
2:02 PM - Bob the Biscuit: even fucking /mlp/ cooperated with everyone
2:02 PM - Delay: too bad it'll be lost in the flood of unrelated discussion
2:02 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: perhaps you have proofs?
2:02 PM - Drshitshow: Coty: when one faction gets to big; 4craft has proven they can put differences aside and work together to take down the mega faction
Bob the Biscuit: even fucking /mlp/ cooperated with everyone
2:02 PM - Drshitshow: THIS
2:02 PM - SalientGreen: we all saw how that one went.
2:02 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Kek I saw the TS Kazuhira, everyone thought it was 10/10 fun
2:02 PM - Bob the Biscuit: shit, but fun
2:02 PM - SalientGreen: /a/ beat them.
2:02 PM - SalientGreen: sadly.
2:02 PM - Coty: not from what I remember
2:02 PM - harbl: bob what kind of wallet do you have
2:02 PM - Kazuhira Miller: Coty: the problem is no one took down /a/
2:02 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: >/a/ uses hacks
2:02 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: hahaha
2:02 PM - ayy lmao: the only way to fight autism is with bigger autism
2:02 PM - SalientGreen: I was /c/ at the time.
2:02 PM - Delay: Whatever, post what you said in the thread at least so people can read it.
2:02 PM - Kazuhira Miller: because autism cubes
2:02 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: comedy gold
2:02 PM - Zemei: the only problem was that it was too hard to kill that big faction
2:02 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: every time
2:02 PM - Coty: or according to that video
2:02 PM - Zemei: due to autism cubes
2:02 PM - harbl: GUYS
2:02 PM - harbl: GUYS
2:02 PM - harbl: GUYS
2:02 PM - harbl: GUSY
2:02 PM - harbl: WALLETS

2:02 PM - Coty: I haven't had to ban yet
2:02 PM - Gakthoil entered chat.
2:03 PM - Bob the Biscuit: All you had to do was chuck tnt down
2:03 PM - harbl: GUYS WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE
2:03 PM - harbl: WALLETS
2:03 PM - ayy lmao: ban yourself to begin with
2:03 PM - Bob the Biscuit: instead of sperging out over one guy hacking
2:03 PM - SalientGreen: but no seriously, balance of power if fucked like a white girl in ahmed town
2:03 PM - Archevei: >someone hacking
2:03 PM - SalientGreen: is*
2:03 PM - Archevei: more axis tears?
2:03 PM - Coty: then instead of complaining baout it, what is your proposal to fix it?
2:03 PM - Bob the Biscuit: One guy who got banned did not stop you tnting their shit to next week
2:03 PM - Bob the Biscuit: not at all
2:03 PM - Mawr: >i was from /c/
2:03 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: axis tears never end
2:03 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: I had over
2:03 PM - Mawr: that explains a lot
2:03 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: 120 kills
2:03 PM - harbl: Can I make a wallet faction
2:03 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: after that raid
2:03 PM - SalientGreen: what's wrong with /c/?
2:03 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: 0 deaths
2:03 PM - harbl was banned by Coty.
2:03 PM - Drshitshow: No everyone set aside their fucking differences because we decided to help smaller factions get set up after being shrekt, not because "Oh /a/ was so big" it was done to try to keep thje server alive
2:03 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: 2ez4artzy
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and you killed the server with it
2:04 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Kek, tiny factions like /u/ survived etc
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: you guys are fuckign retards
2:04 PM - Bob the Biscuit: they had fucking wooden houses
2:04 PM - Mawr: Well in the mentioned v5, /c/ betrayed /a/
2:04 PM - Bob the Biscuit: non got burned down
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: especially thatree
2:04 PM - Coty: 4:03 PM - Coty: then instead of complaining baout it, what is your proposal to fix it?
2:04 PM - Gakthoil disconnected.
2:04 PM - Archevei: daily reminder that /a/ never touched /c/ throughout all of v5
2:04 PM - SalientGreen: /c/ didn't do shit. metharos made a choice and took some volunteers.
2:04 PM - whateveridentity: something I forgot but read in my doc: worth noting: 5 IRL days comes to 360 in game days, or almost a year. A year of peace/year of war seems fitting
2:04 PM - Mawr: And rallied other boards against them
2:04 PM - Drshitshow: Citadel.
2:04 PM - Archevei: you are all mindless sheeple
2:04 PM - Kazuhira Miller: I think we need to re-address the waller issue
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: /c/ did do shit m8
2:04 PM - Coty: I agree with arch
2:04 PM - Mawr: Metharos, the leader of /c/
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: metharos and thatree
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: did it all
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and lied like fuck
2:04 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: to try and make it happen
2:04 PM - SalientGreen: prove it.
2:04 PM - Mid: i'd remove the people in charge of 4craft and replace them with other people, why else has it failed 6 times in a row?
2:05 PM - Mawr: le recorded conversations faec
2:05 PM - Coty: 4craft admins change every iteration, Mid
2:05 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Is this about the /c/ false flag?
2:05 PM - Mid: why are you here then?
2:05 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: it wasnt just a false flag
2:05 PM - Coty: I did a handful myself
2:05 PM - Coty: and now doing this one, though
2:05 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: metharos and thattree tried to remove people from adminship
2:05 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and lied a shitload
2:05 PM - SalientGreen: bassu burned down /c/ island
2:05 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: in the end all they did was kill the serber
2:05 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: even faster
2:05 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Oh yeah that time they tried to get me banned
2:05 PM - Bob the Biscuit: cause their plan failed
2:05 PM - Archevei: DAILY REMINDER BETACLAY AND THATREE ARE THE SOURCE OF ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS
2:05 PM - Archevei: YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED IT
2:05 PM - Coty: v6 was completely made of new admins, Mid
2:05 PM - Coty: v5 was mostly new
2:05 PM - Zemei: lolslime
2:05 PM - ayy lmao: kek i destroyd betaclays faction is v6
2:06 PM - SalientGreen: v6 died so damn quick
2:06 PM - ayy lmao: literally everything
2:06 PM - Mid: who was betaclay again
2:06 PM - Coty: I helped a tiny bit at the start of v5 but that was it
2:06 PM - SalientGreen: s4s lasted three days
2:06 PM - Archevei: a faggot madmin we blew out
2:06 PM - Mid: honestly
2:06 PM - Mid: the metagame in 4craft
2:06 PM - Mid: is so fucking awful
2:06 PM - Drshitshow: Is what breaks it
2:06 PM - Mid: it will always die
2:06 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: v6 was literally just me, with slime doing some stuff, and coty being uncontrollable bob-tier admin spawning bedrock everywhere
2:06 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: theres a metagame
2:06 PM - Coty: What is your proposal to fix it then, Mid?
2:06 PM - Mid: you cant
2:06 PM - Mawr: >metagame
2:06 PM - whateveridentity: well thanks for playing mid
2:06 PM - Coty: then why even join the discussion?
2:06 PM - Mawr: it's called balance settings
2:06 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: is this like muh mobas
2:07 PM - Gakthoil entered chat.
2:07 PM - Mid: so
2:07 PM - Mid: actually will tnt be allowed on enemy territory yet
2:07 PM - SalientGreen: so /a/ your armor xp exploit, isn't meta as fuck?
2:07 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: xp exploit
2:07 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: hahahahaha
2:07 PM - Mid: thats taken like 6 versions to do
2:07 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: this guy
2:07 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: it was tho
2:07 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: the only people who did an xp exploit
2:07 PM - Coty: dude what
2:07 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: was /v/
2:07 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: in v1
2:07 PM - Coty: tnt has been allowed since day 1
2:07 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: when potatos worked
2:07 PM - Coty: except for like 1 iteration I think
2:07 PM - Mid: no on enemy territory coty
2:07 PM - Coty: you just have to launch it
2:07 PM - Mawr: he means placing
2:07 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: also everyone did that exploit in v1
2:07 PM - Kazuhira Miller: >tnt has been allowed since day 1
2:08 PM - Mawr: he's just a casual
2:08 PM - Kazuhira Miller: toppest kek
2:08 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: pretty much but /v/ discovered
2:08 PM - Mawr: >i wanna run around in enemy territory and spam tnt
2:08 PM - Mawr: babby tier
2:08 PM - Coty: Anyways guys it's lunch/dinner break time. I'll be back later to help discuss more shit
2:08 PM - Coty: I'll skim over this chat window when I get back
2:08 PM - Kazuhira Miller: >i wanna sit inside a cube for two weeks and have no fun
2:08 PM - Archevei: go get shot in downtown stillwater
2:08 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: no faction/territory perms
2:08 PM - whateveridentity: k
2:08 PM - Mawr: yea, those two are exclusive
2:08 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: would be awful
2:08 PM - Coty: I'll have you know I have only heard a single gunshot here before
2:08 PM - Mid: "I'd rather dox people and sit in my floating fort"
2:08 PM - Coty: anyways be back alter
2:08 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: placing tnt in enemy territory would only work if there were citadel-like protections or something
2:09 PM - Mawr: more like
2:09 PM - Kazuhira Miller: which, guess what, Civcraft has
2:09 PM - Mawr: >id rather shoot it
2:09 PM - Mawr: wow
2:09 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: civcraft is shit
2:09 PM - Mawr: so hard
2:09 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: leddit tier
2:09 PM - Drshitshow: >implying
2:09 PM - Kazuhira Miller: all these implications
2:09 PM - Pip: id like citadels too
2:09 PM - Mawr: but i know
2:09 PM - Pip: man i like everything
2:09 PM - Mawr: >cannons too hard
2:09 PM - Mawr: >thinking too hard
2:09 PM - Pip: i just want to 4craft
2:09 PM - Mawr: >reading server settings too hard
2:09 PM - Mid: You guys just keep telling yourself that iterations and resets are all part of the 4craft experience
2:09 PM - whateveridentity: On that note, do people like Citadel? Would it be worth using?
2:09 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: i want to make
2:09 PM - SalientGreen: /tg/ thought so in v6 mawr
2:09 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: a cute anime town
2:09 PM - Mawr: >improving over iterations
2:09 PM - Mid: its not 4craft dying
2:09 PM - Mawr: >too hard
2:09 PM - Mid: its just 4craft resetting
2:09 PM - Mid: its a feature
2:10 PM - SalientGreen: >what was /c/ island?
2:10 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: shit
2:10 PM - Kazuhira Miller: REMINDER that /tg/ blew themselves up and started purgining their own members
2:10 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: I like citadel but I wouldn't want it as-is
2:10 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: you guys just
2:10 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: killed teh server
2:10 PM - Kazuhira Miller: in v6
2:10 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and burnt your own town down
2:10 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: nice going weebs
2:10 PM - SalientGreen: >implying we killed the server
2:10 PM - ayy lmao: >/a/
2:10 PM - ­Patchouli Knowledge: I turned int+fit's base to TNT :^)
2:10 PM - ayy lmao: >calls other weebs
2:10 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: implying we arent all from reddit
2:10 PM - Kazuhira Miller: hope you guys enjoy /a/craft
2:10 PM - Mawr: You are right Mid, that mindset is cancerous
2:10 PM - Pip: use citadel and then all the people butthurt about peacetime/wartime will be happy
2:10 PM - Kazuhira Miller left chat.
2:11 PM - Pip: i t-think
2:11 PM - Mid: and people like coty genuinely think that 4craft dying every month
2:11 PM - Mid: is part of 4craft
2:11 PM - Mawr: yeah
2:11 PM - Mid: its a feature
2:11 PM - SalientGreen: not a feature for fuck's sake.
2:11 PM - whateveridentity: Can citadel be layered on top of a factions server, in an effort to take advantage of its elements with a Factions style gameplay? Only played some civcraft so the whole thing's foreign to me
2:11 PM - Mawr: The aim of each iteration should be to keep the server alive for as long as possible
2:11 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Well if it didnt reset alot people would burn out, half of 4craft is everyone switching into hyper autism mode
2:11 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: its a feature until someone can afford to host a server
2:11 PM - Mid: its a blatant by product of gross imbalancement on the server
2:11 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: for a long time
2:11 PM - Drshitshow: In a sense
2:11 PM - Pip: yes what
2:11 PM - Bob the Biscuit: for fun
2:12 PM - Pip: protections from factions can be disabled
2:12 PM - Drshitshow: you'd have to turn off claims though
2:12 PM - Mid: because the server dies when that one faction jews out
2:12 PM - SalientGreen: the problem is /a/ as always.
2:12 PM - Mid: and then they hide in their panic cubes because you cant get into enemy territory
2:12 PM - SalientGreen: all they do is burn the little guys
2:12 PM - Bob the Biscuit: /a/ isnt a problem
2:12 PM - Bob the Biscuit: they are easy to beat
2:12 PM - Mid: yes it is
2:12 PM - Mawr: >people who try to play good are the problem
2:12 PM - SalientGreen: >implying
2:12 PM - Bob the Biscuit: it's everyone being shit
2:12 PM - SalientGreen: you talk shit
2:12 PM - Bob the Biscuit: It may ever be a problem with the format of 4craft
2:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: but you autists just blame it on /a/
2:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: be constructive
2:13 PM - Mid: /a/ just fucking retards out with the protection system
2:13 PM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM: I have no strong opinions about things in general
2:13 PM - SalientGreen: /a/ are autistic as fuck. destroy all the small players before they can set up
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: /a/ didnt even kill the server
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: /c/ killed it
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: by getting everyone to attack /a/
2:13 PM - SalientGreen: bullshit.
2:13 PM - Mid: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: literally
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: nothing had happened before then
2:13 PM - Mid: shill harder
2:13 PM - ayy lmao: shut up /a/ shill
2:13 PM - Mawr: If people's good play causes problems then the server balance settings are bad
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: /pol/ attacked /a/
2:13 PM - SalientGreen: /a/ shill
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: /c/ attacked /a/
2:13 PM - Bob the Biscuit: There's shittons of small factions still alive in 4craft
2:13 PM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM: But if /a/ is so troubling, why not just attempt an interation that disallows /a/ from taking part?
2:13 PM - Drshitshow: ....
2:13 PM - Mid: /a/ DINDU NUFFIN
2:13 PM - Mid: LEL
2:13 PM - Drshitshow: .......
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: >I have no arguments because im retarded better call him a shill
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: HOW THE FUCK
2:13 PM - SalientGreen: metharos attacked /a/ with some volunteers.
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: CAN YOU BE A SHILL
2:13 PM - DIN DO NUFFIN: IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY

2:01 AM - Mawr entered chat.
2:48 AM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM entered chat.
3:30 AM - Delay: mic test
3:31 AM - Delay: roll call, who's paying attention to chat
3:31 AM - Delay: monkey?
3:31 AM - Delay: patchy?
3:31 AM - Delay: Rave?
3:31 AM - Delay: Noscope?
3:31 AM - Delay: Rando?
3:31 AM - Delay: Zenmei?
3:41 AM - Mawr: :?
3:41 AM - Mawr: eh time to make a doc for v7
3:43 AM - Delay: yes
3:44 AM - Delay: talked to coty a bit before going to bed
3:46 AM - Delay: we'll use armorweight
3:47 AM - Delay: just needs some configuring to not be too annoying
3:48 AM - Delay: there's this thing I have to write up concerning craft manipulation, turning off creeper explosions, obsidian breaker, and disabling water from negating tnt blasts
3:49 AM - Delay: and then there's VFP
3:49 AM - Delay: almost definitely going to use primetime per day
3:50 AM - Delay: and enchant limiter
3:50 AM - Delay: gonna have to rethink that taking into consideration the new armorweights
3:51 AM - Delay: haven't talked to him about tp runes
3:52 AM - Delay: but if we're doing it he wants to use runecraft's insted of the one I brought up
3:52 AM - Rando: >runes
3:52 AM - Delay: based off of what he said in the chat before
3:52 AM - Rando: coty wins again
3:52 AM - Rando: telling everyone I know not to play
3:52 AM - Delay: ONLY TP RUNES
3:52 AM - Delay: that's why I want to use this other plugin though
3:53 AM - Delay: it's much simpler to use and learn
3:53 AM - Delay: you don't need to know more about it to get the most out of it
3:54 AM - Delay: it just teleports one way
3:55 AM - Delay: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/teleportationrunes/
4:01 AM - Mawr: with peacetime/wartime you dont really need obsidian breaker
4:01 AM - Mawr: or to mess with water
4:02 AM - Delay: guess you can
4:02 AM - Delay: 't see it
4:02 AM - Delay: wartime should have reduced protections
4:03 AM - Delay: doing this makes it both harder and easier to defend in a way
4:03 AM - Delay: water won't force attackers to use sand cannons
4:04 AM - Mawr: hmm i think i like this
4:04 AM - Delay: and higher block hp makes it harder to break through things in general
4:04 AM - Delay: then there's also the x3 tnt gain
4:07 AM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM: here
4:07 AM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM: Can I get the lowdown on how the peacetime/wartime discussion went
4:07 AM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM: and how it'll work
4:07 AM - Delay: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzKd-DJ_Jg0LofEGVxH_IGtKvEtFDTLrCG02Eygf3aY/edit
4:09 AM - Mawr: forgot to ask Coty, pirate friendly or not :?
4:10 AM - Mawr: kinda important
4:10 AM - Delay: probably friendly
4:12 AM - Rando disconnected.
4:16 AM - Mawr: enchantment levels?
4:16 AM - Mawr: not discussed right
4:17 AM - Delay: v6 levels as placeholders
4:17 AM - Delay: I Fire Aspect, I Punch, I Knockback, II Thorns, II Power, II Protection, III Sharpness, III Projectile Protection.
4:18 AM - Delay: you figured out yourself how the obsidianbreaker thing would work, right?
4:19 AM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM: Bit curious, is there anything that won't be brought over to v7 that was in v6 and before
4:20 AM - Mawr: i think so delay
4:20 AM - Delay: potion balance, maybe?
4:21 AM - NOSCOPENOPROBLEM: I don't remember the potion balance well, were they not used much or used too often despite the rebalancing
4:21 AM - Delay: dunno about v6 really
4:22 AM - Delay: aside from that, nothing worth noting I think
4:32 AM - Mawr: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t2QXPax9B91IJTdhGHS-ePiQhdaykrg8Rhlg4WuUu6Q
4:32 AM - Mawr: just an initial draft
4:34 AM - Delay: potion nerfs will have to be talked about
4:35 AM - Mawr: yeah i just left a lot of things as they were in v6
4:36 AM - Delay: link to v6 doc
4:37 AM - Mawr: >
4:37 AM - Mawr: It was the /a/ doc
4:37 AM - Mawr: le super secret
4:37 AM - Delay: then pm it to me
4:37 AM - Delay: doesn't matter
4:37 AM - Delay: or wait
4:38 AM - Mawr: everything relevant is here
4:38 AM - Mawr: i just removed the /a/-specific talks about cheats and exploits
4:38 AM - Mawr: and some v6-specific shit slime said
4:44 AM - Mawr: ayy lamo
4:45 AM - Delay: wow
4:45 AM - Delay: rude
4:45 AM - Mawr: am i dum or wat

4:47 AM - Delay: do you think potions really need to get rebalanced?
4:47 AM - Tricky: there isnt much consistency to them in the base game
4:47 AM - Tricky: iirc weakness is almost completely useless
4:48 AM - Mawr: le +360% dmg
4:48 AM - Delay: alright then
4:48 AM - Mawr: or 260 w/e
4:48 AM - Delay: make a section for things to discuss
4:48 AM - Tricky: 100% is still pretty hefty
4:48 AM - Delay: enchant levels while considering armor weight
4:49 AM - Delay: and potion rebalance
4:49 AM - Delay: I have to shit
4:49 AM - Delay: afk
4:49 AM - Tricky: my least favourite "balance" change is removing bedrock
4:49 AM - ayy lmao entered chat.
4:50 AM - Mawr: totally forgot how to do some things
5:00 AM - Mawr: §§§§§§§§
5:02 AM - Mawr: http://tinyurl.com/4craftv7info
5:05 AM - Delay: enchant levels and armor weight at the same time
5:05 AM - Delay: they influence each other
5:05 AM - Delay: then potion stats
5:13 AM - Tricky: so about this 4 hours
5:13 AM - Tricky: all thats said is "very weak" protections
5:13 AM - Delay: yet to be decided on
5:13 AM - Delay: but I like the idea of turning off water protection
5:14 AM - Tricky: its just gonna be r/a/ping time though right
5:14 AM - Delay: while increasing the tnt resistance of most building blocks
5:15 AM - Tricky: that basically turns bases to paper for 4 hours
5:15 AM - Tricky: arent things already difficult enough for smaller boards?
5:16 AM - Delay: not paper
5:16 AM - Delay: it'll take maybe 2-3 times more tnt to break through
5:16 AM - Delay: hell maybe more
5:17 AM - Delay: it just removes that near absolute defense
5:17 AM - Delay: of water
5:17 AM - Tricky: you can already use buckets
5:17 AM - Delay: also to fuck over cheeky underwater bases
5:17 AM - Tricky: all the big factions are just going to mass farm tnt
5:18 AM - Delay: yea, to breach bases for wartime
5:18 AM - Delay: it's not supposed to be too difficult to attack a base
5:18 AM - Tricky: im assuming the enchantment caps dont change the levels you get prot 2at
5:18 AM - Delay: no
5:19 AM - Delay: just caps the levels of enchants
5:20 AM - Tricky: you must appreciate the 4 hours is going to be horrible for the small fry
5:20 AM - Tricky: your ability to defend yourself is based on your player count rather than structure
5:21 AM - Delay: there's more to it than just big factions shitting on smaller ones
5:21 AM - Tricky: lets not pretend that isn't exactly what will happen though
5:21 AM - Delay: everyone, big and small, becomes vulnerable
5:21 AM - Mawr: >Tricky: your ability to defend yourself is based on your player count rather than structure
5:21 AM - Tricky: do they though?
5:21 AM - Delay: it'll happen in some cases
5:22 AM - Mawr: that's exactly why there's 1 time for raiding
5:22 AM - ayy lmao left chat.
5:22 AM - Delay: but when you think more about it
5:22 AM - Delay: those big factions would be spending time and resources to attack a small faction leaving themselves open for counterattack from other factions
5:22 AM - Delay: either big or small as well
5:23 AM - Delay: then there's also the ability for others to assist the defending faction
5:23 AM - Delay: through the teleporters that can be built
5:23 AM - Tricky: if gathering resources to attack leaves you open, that only makes things worse for smaller groups
5:23 AM - Delay: the gathering is done in peace time
5:24 AM - Mawr: Attacking leaves you open to being attacked
5:24 AM - Delay: the attack is what leaves them open
5:24 AM - Mawr: Potentially at least
5:24 AM - Mawr: Not too big of a deal as you can just /f home
5:24 AM - Delay: everyone can attack everyone
5:24 AM - Tricky: everything you have described comes down to player count being the most important factor
5:24 AM - Delay: it's not a 1v1 kind of thing
5:25 AM - Mawr: Yeah, it comes down to whether you care enough to get online every day for ~4 hours
5:25 AM - Mawr: probably less
5:25 AM - Delay: yep
5:25 AM - Mawr: 90% of raids will begin when the wartime starts
5:25 AM - Mawr: *right after
5:25 AM - Delay: also you have to understand
5:25 AM - Delay: raids don't have to be 1v1
5:26 AM - Delay: people can assist either side
5:26 AM - Delay: who gets the assistance is up to the smaller faction's relations
5:27 AM - Delay: if they get attacked in the first place and not just ignored
5:27 AM - Delay: they might be potentially easier to raid but the rewwards are also pretty small
5:28 AM - Delay: and they'd still be risking their own defense
5:28 AM - Delay: there's a lot more factors in play than you might have thought
5:44 AM - Mawr: spoken like a true shill
5:45 AM - Delay: ;)
5:53 AM - Tricky: i appreciate that its more complicated than 1v1
5:54 AM - Delay: its always been that way
5:54 AM - Tricky: but it's 1 faction, and those arent equal
5:56 AM - Delay: the system is equal, the players will just have to do what they can to make up for the numbers disadvantage
5:56 AM - Delay: from skill to politics
5:56 AM - Delay: mostly politics if it's a numbers thing
5:56 AM - Tricky: there is a difference between fairness and equality
5:57 AM - Delay: there's no real way to make up for a lack of players
5:57 AM - Mawr: Or just make it so your base takes more than 4 hours to penetrate
5:57 AM - Tomato entered chat.
5:57 AM - Tricky: Interesting suggestion mawr
5:57 AM - Delay: really, it's already not very hard to defend a base against overwhelming odds
5:57 AM - Delay: look at /a/
5:58 AM - Tricky: I'm not sure I follow
5:58 AM - Mawr: he's talking about v5
5:58 AM - Delay: if you really wanted to, you could easily abandon your base as well for the 4 hours
5:58 AM - Delay: live in the woods and then come back
5:58 AM - Mawr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2nQoNuT6eA
5:59 AM - Delay: if you wanna be a bitch
5:59 AM - Delay: you'd die less meaning it's less likely they'll be able to take over your base
6:00 AM - Delay: as I said, there's much more in play going on
6:00 AM - Delay: but it's up to the players to make use of it
6:00 AM - Tricky: it defeats the original purpose
6:00 AM - Tricky: there was an idea of board conflict, but you said it yourself
6:01 AM - Tricky: lower down the food chain, you team up or get rekt
6:01 AM - Delay: really, you don't have to
6:01 AM - Delay: it's just more advantageous
6:01 AM - Delay: if you wanna lone wolf shit
6:01 AM - Delay: you shouldn't expect the system to make things easier for you
6:02 AM - Delay: tnt treats all blocks equally
6:02 AM - Tricky: I'm not the one looking after my own interests here
6:02 AM - Mawr: here we go
6:02 AM - Tricky: it's no secret the server is all ogre in about a week, and i think we should be looking at ways of extending the lifespan
6:02 AM - Tricky: instead of shortening it
6:03 AM - Mawr: that's what this change is trying to do goy
6:03 AM - Delay: did you even read the doc?
6:03 AM - Mawr: unless you think "raids" where it's 20 attackers vs 5 defenders are fun
6:04 AM - Mawr: and that breaking into undefended bases is ebin
6:05 AM - Tricky: if you're upset about breaking into undefended bases
6:05 AM - Tricky: isn't it curious you want less land protection?
6:05 AM - Delay: no
6:05 AM - Mawr: i dont think you quite get the point of the idea
6:05 AM - Delay: it's up to the player to defend their base
6:05 AM - Delay: not the system
6:06 AM - Delay: well not the system to an extent
6:06 AM - Mawr: it used to be you had to stay on alert 24/7
6:06 AM - Mawr: because you could be raided at any time
6:06 AM - Mawr: now you only have to defend for 4 hours a day
6:06 AM - Delay: now you'll know when it MIGHT happen
6:07 AM - Delay: and even then you'll have enough time in between to put up layers and layers of blocks to defend against tnt
6:07 AM - Delay: instead of just having at least one behind a sheet of water
6:07 AM - Delay: the blocks would also be more difficult to break in the first place
6:08 AM - Delay: how is this a problem?
6:08 AM - Tomato: when would the attacking period be
6:08 AM - Delay: it removes a near-absolute defense option utilized by every autismcube
6:08 AM - Tricky: mid afternoon for murrica, late night for europe
6:08 AM - Delay: and boosts general defenses
6:09 AM - Tricky: Did you read your doc
6:09 AM - Tricky: you know buckets work in enemy territory right?
6:09 AM - Delay: what are you gonna do, pick up flowing water?
6:09 AM - Delay: put lava on a sheet?
6:10 AM - Delay: only for the opening to be covered up by the new flow of water?
6:10 AM - Tricky: Flowing water usually flows from somewhere
6:10 AM - Mawr: usually from an infinite source
6:11 AM - Tricky: You can destroy an infinite source with lava or buckets
6:11 AM - Delay: and even then, you're left with the same shit defense-wise
6:11 AM - Tricky: not at all
6:11 AM - Delay: wow the sheet is gone
6:11 AM - Tricky: i seem to remember pol had a water curtain last server
6:11 AM - Tricky: and that didnt work out so well for them
6:12 AM - Delay: it served its purpose
6:12 AM - Delay: to make it harder to penetrate
6:12 AM - Delay: which is what we'd be doing
6:12 AM - Tricky: so do you see why i object to you saying "near absolute defence"
6:13 AM - Delay: it's near absolute because you have to get rid of it to stop being absolute
6:13 AM - Delay: sand cannons too
6:13 AM - Tricky: nigga wat
6:13 AM - Tricky: you might as well say a wall of dirt is absolute defence then
6:13 AM - Tricky: because you have to get rid of that to get in too
6:13 AM - Delay: the water
6:14 AM - Delay: jesus christ
6:14 AM - Delay: you have to get rid of the water in an unusual and arguably difficult way
6:14 AM - Delay: so you stand a chance at breaching that area
6:14 AM - Delay: you can't just brute force it
6:15 AM - Delay: because tnt will just not work period.
6:15 AM - Delay: and once removed, we're in the same boat
6:16 AM - Tricky: it sounds to me you just want raiding to be easier
6:17 AM - Delay: pretty much, it'll be easier but not that much easier
6:17 AM - Delay: defenders aren't just going to sit there jerking off
6:17 AM - Delay: they know WHEN they might be attacked
6:17 AM - Delay: the blocks would resist tnt better so repairing the defense is a viable option
6:17 AM - Delay: then there's also repelling the attackers
6:18 AM - Delay: possibly even chain claiming over their cannons
6:18 AM - Delay: though that's gonna be difficult against the more advanced types
6:18 AM - Delay: there's also always the possibility of asking for assistance
6:19 AM - Mawr: just remove claiming during wartime
6:19 AM - Mawr: 2op
6:19 AM - Delay: or some other faction taking the chance to attack the faction of the ones attacking you
6:19 AM - Mawr: just allow the attacking faction to overclaim when applicable
6:20 AM - Mawr: claiming over cannons is unbelievably stupid
6:20 AM - Mawr: it's mentioned in the doc as well :^)
6:20 AM - Delay: and there's a chance the big one gets assistance somehow at which point you might as well cut your losses and abandon ship so as not to lose too much power
6:20 AM - Delay: that is if you don't get assistance as well
6:20 AM - Tricky: well thats just it isnt it
6:21 AM - Delay: POLITICS are a part of the game
6:21 AM - Tricky: when you dont have any sort of protection, you can run or die
6:21 AM - Tricky: h-have fun guys
6:21 AM - Delay: if you want to lone wolf, don't get found
6:21 AM - Delay: you already have protection
6:21 AM - Delay: but nothing absolute
6:21 AM - Tricky: there wasnt any absolute protection before
6:21 AM - Mawr: le conveniently ignore arguments
6:21 AM - Mawr: 14:06 - Mawr: it used to be you had to stay on alert 24/7
14:06 - Mawr: because you could be raided at any time
14:06 - Mawr: now you only have to defend for 4 hours a day
6:22 AM - Mawr: quite simple really
6:22 AM - Delay: if you make no effort to defend yourself you're gonna get shat on
6:22 AM - Tricky: sucks for the people who work those hours, right
6:22 AM - Mawr: yep
6:23 AM - Mawr: timezones are an issue
6:23 AM - Delay: it's the exact same shit that will happen even without the change in defense
6:23 AM - Tricky: not really
6:24 AM - Delay: so what you want
6:24 AM - Delay: is the ability to make autismcubes?
6:24 AM - Tricky: not quite, I want there to be a meeting in the middle ground
6:24 AM - Delay: to just sit in and do nothing while attackers can't do anything about it
6:24 AM - Delay: this is the middle ground
6:25 AM - Delay: and you keep bitching about it
6:25 AM - Tricky: no, this is ezmode for big factions
6:25 AM - Tricky: youre being a bit unreasonable mang, im just explaining where i stand
6:25 AM - Delay: everything but autismcubes is ezmode for big factions in this case
6:26 AM - Tricky: we already established last server that there is no perfect base
6:26 AM - Delay: everything we've brought up has been to make things simpler for everyone
6:26 AM - Tricky: so why are we lowering protections for 4 hours?
6:26 AM - Mawr: how many times must i re-say this
6:26 AM - Mawr: 14:06 - Mawr: it used to be you had to stay on alert 24/7
14:06 - Mawr: because you could be raided at any time
14:06 - Mawr: now you only have to defend for 4 hours a day
6:27 AM - Tricky: but you're only saying that because you're ignoring my point
6:27 AM - Tricky: if protections were raised outside the 4 hours, your argument would make sense
6:27 AM - Mawr: It makes for easier time defending for the most of the day, and harder during wartime
6:27 AM - Delay: raiders are part of the "everyone"
6:27 AM - Delay: they are
6:27 AM - Mawr: THEY ARE
6:27 AM - Delay: protections are raised to absolute immunity from explosions
6:27 AM - Mawr: You practically cant get raided outside of 4hours/day
6:28 AM - Delay: it's like you didn't even fucking read the doc
6:28 AM - Delay: jesus christ
6:28 AM - Delay: did you think that you could argue about shit properly by just skimming through the subject?
6:29 AM - Tricky: you have to admit, its pretty vague
6:30 AM - Delay: it isn't
6:30 AM - Delay: almost every question to be asked is tackled on the doc
6:30 AM - Mawr: Well, yeah the doc is flexible in how it presents the details
6:30 AM - Mawr: like 'enhanced protections during peacetime'
6:31 AM - Mawr: 'enhanced' is pretty vague
6:31 AM - Mawr: Mostly because the exact details need to be worked out by looking at how the idea works with other server settings/plugins
6:32 AM - Tricky: i dont remember reading anything about immunity from explosions
6:33 AM - Mawr: that's a detail right there
6:33 AM - Mawr: all the details are being worked out
6:33 AM - Mawr: we've only really started yesterday
6:33 AM - Delay: that's the only thing you can really do to enhance protections though
6:34 AM - Delay: what else are you gonna do, make players immune from pvp in their territory?
6:34 AM - Mawr: Peacetime core settings
Block protection on.
Lava is not placeable or removable.
Water is not placeable or removable.
Explosions do not affect faction territory.
Arguably this would be personal preference, as without the ability to manipulate water/lava you could still make indestructible bases. My personal opinion is that it should be left as is, so people can make cool shit without fear of it being trashed at 5am.
6:34 AM - Delay: that'd be going too far
6:35 AM - Tricky: it said before that buckets had full functionality on enemy territory, guess that got snipped
6:35 AM - Mawr: yea m8
6:35 AM - Mawr: unless before is weeks ago
6:36 AM - Tricky: yesterday
6:36 AM - Mawr: nope
6:36 AM - Mawr: i havent made a change that isnt purely wording/formatting in a long time
6:37 AM - Tricky: looks like someone else has snipped quite a lot
6:38 AM - Delay: what now?
6:38 AM - Mawr: since yesterday?
6:39 AM - Mawr: the whole thing got a pretty big overhaul on nov 01
6:39 AM - Mawr: since then only wording/formatting changes
6:39 AM - Tricky: there was a bit about perms thats gone
6:40 AM - Tricky: buckets, explosions, nether claims
6:40 AM - Tricky: you asked me if i read the doc, but i think a beter question would be if I read it today
6:41 AM - Mawr: oh we arent talking about the same thing
6:41 AM - Delay: oh boy

6:42 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So as I was saying, serbians are all liars
6:42 AM - Mawr: the v7 doc changes quite a bit, because it's only been started a couple of hours ago
6:42 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: :^)
6:42 AM - Mawr: remove serb
6:42 AM - Mawr: i've removed the buckets part because it doesnt make sense to have it with peace/wartime
6:43 AM - Mawr: not in its current form
6:43 AM - Dante: NICE
6:43 AM - Tricky: fair enough, I take back some of my reservations
6:43 AM - Tricky: but the implication from the early doc was that enemies could always use buckets
6:44 AM - Delay: what doc was that?
6:44 AM - Mawr: sure i guess
6:44 AM - Delay: I doubt it was anything that took the VFP into account at least
6:44 AM - Tricky: no, it didnt
6:44 AM - Mawr: the v7 one, it was one of the v6 settings
6:44 AM - Mawr: yea delay
6:44 AM - Delay: didn't you make that like an hour ago?
6:45 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >get friend invite from someone not in any group with me nor friends with any of my friends
6:45 AM - Mawr: make the change?
6:45 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
6:45 AM - Mawr: sexy boys like you are popular~
6:46 AM - Delay: I got a couple as well
6:46 AM - Delay: one asked to trade cards
6:46 AM - Tricky: think it's popular for item scammers to build a faux history
6:46 AM - Delay: I told him no so he asked why
6:46 AM - Delay: I said I can't be bothered
6:47 AM - Delay: joke's on them
6:47 AM - Delay: I have nothing to trade
6:47 AM - Tricky: could well have been one of your friends

6:52 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Someone said, on r9k, that it's the new tumblr

6:54 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Use use that Zealous
6:54 AM - Zealous: someone sent it to me before
6:55 AM - Zealous: but I thought it might be a fucking screamer
6:55 AM - Zealous: or something
6:55 AM - Mawr: ebin
6:55 AM - Zealous: muh paranoia
6:55 AM - Zealous: fuck it
6:55 AM - Zealous: wow it's actually legit cool
6:58 AM - Zealous: so anyway
6:59 AM - Zealous: can we agree to ban /a/
7:13 AM - Tomato disconnected.
7:30 AM - Mawr: Yeah so i think i put every single suggested idea in the doc.
7:40 AM - Mawr left chat.
7:40 AM - Mawr entered chat.
7:49 AM - Delay: isn't fire spread needed to light things on fire?
7:50 AM - Mawr: Depends
7:50 AM - Mawr: When you disable it through essentials or whatever then no
7:51 AM - Mawr: You should be able to set things on fire but they wont burn down i think
7:51 AM - Delay: alright
7:51 AM - Delay: might want to make a note of that
7:53 AM - Delay: bedrock is a maybe
7:53 AM - Delay: and reminds me that I have to remind coty about making it impossible to claim territories on world borders
7:54 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: bedrock :^)
7:57 AM - Delay: Obsidian and Enchantment Tables can be destroyed with 4 explosions, Anvils with 3; the damage regenerates over time, currently 8 hours.
7:57 AM - Delay: when was that regen time decided?
7:57 AM - Delay: seems excessive
7:58 AM - Delay: especially when you'd get the same resuslt from replacing the block
7:58 AM - Delay: hell, even removing it and putting it back
7:59 AM - Delay: was it carried over from v6?
7:59 AM - Zealous: did you put in the suggestion to ban /a/
7:59 AM - Delay: damn slime
7:59 AM - Zealous: like seriously did you?
7:59 AM - Delay: no
7:59 AM - Zealous: why
7:59 AM - Zealous: /a/ ruins 4craft tho
7:59 AM - Delay: why would I?
7:59 AM - Dante: Why ?
7:59 AM - Dante: /a/ is literally our greatest ally
7:59 AM - Zealous: no
7:59 AM - Zealous: /a/ is litterally killing 4craft
7:59 AM - Dante: they roll over everyone
7:59 AM - Zealous: they roll over everyone
8:00 AM - Dante: They uh
8:00 AM - Dante: redecorated your place
8:00 AM - Dante: didn't they
8:00 AM - Delay: it's not /a/ itself, it's the faction representing /a/
8:00 AM - Zealous: :^)
8:00 AM - Dante: That is very nice
8:00 AM - Dante: jk bby
8:00 AM - Dante: pls no hurtie
8:00 AM - Zealous: no, delay
8:00 AM - Zealous: after 6 versions of /a/ steamrolling
8:00 AM - Zealous: I can say it's /a/ itself
8:00 AM - Zealous: being fucking autistic
8:01 AM - Delay: the big guns of /a/ have left to join other factions
8:01 AM - Zealous: bullshit
8:01 AM - Delay: there are claims that Djinra isn't playing
8:01 AM - Zealous: what is a smurf
8:01 AM - Mawr: That was in v6 yes delay
8:01 AM - Zealous: what is someone just using a differnt account
8:01 AM - Zealous: it's not me honest gauise :^)
8:01 AM - Delay: I wish but I doubt it since he told me how he works back in v5
8:02 AM - Mawr: >bullshit
8:02 AM - Mawr: >alister didnt leave at all
8:02 AM - Mawr: >its just shilling goys
8:02 AM - Zealous: ..
8:02 AM - Mawr: he made a post in one of the v6 threads on vg
8:02 AM - Mawr: might be able to find it
8:03 AM - Zealous: it doesn't matter if some of the faggots that normally play are not there; the faction itself steamrolls every single time
8:03 AM - Zealous: and you know it
8:03 AM - Delay: it's because of the faggots that are leaving that they manage to steamroll
8:03 AM - Zealous: no it isn't
8:03 AM - Delay: what was that saying about parts making a whole?
8:03 AM - Zealous: oh dear
8:03 AM - Zealous: I just went over this
8:04 AM - Zealous: SMURFS
8:04 AM - Zealous: they can say they are not playing all they want
8:04 AM - Delay: and seriously, if they're gonna go through the trouble they can easily just rebrand
8:04 AM - Zealous: fact is they steamroll every time and every time you say uhh honest guys X and Y isnt playing this time its finf!
8:04 AM - Zealous: and it never is
8:04 AM - Delay: it's not something that can realistically be dealt with
8:05 AM - Zealous: is that not exactly what your trying to do right now
8:05 AM - Delay: at least not by the "system"
8:05 AM - Zealous: muh /a/ is not full of autists which take the game too seriously
8:05 AM - Mawr: I'd like to inform you that a 'faction' isn't a some magical entity that does things
8:05 AM - Dante: we all know zealous is the spy
8:05 AM - Zealous: it's the PARTS that make up the whole!
8:05 AM - Zealous: honest guys!
8:05 AM - Mawr: A faction is just a term to describe a group of people
8:06 AM - Zealous: as I said, smurfs
8:06 AM - Mawr: >alister is lying
8:06 AM - Mawr: ok
8:06 AM - Delay: even so
8:06 AM - Zealous: >implying he doesn't lie out his teeth all the time
8:06 AM - Delay: what do you think can be done about it?
8:06 AM - Zealous: ban /a/
8:06 AM - Delay: in this case we're just reporting good news
8:06 AM - Mawr: cool implication
8:06 AM - Zealous: what
8:06 AM - Zealous: seriously are you going to aruge that
8:06 AM - Delay: wow ban /a/ and the same group in smurfs just pops up
8:06 AM - Delay: what, are we gonna ban them too?
8:06 AM - Zealous: after all the exploiting /a/ does, lying to everyone
8:07 AM - Zealous: betraying everyone
8:07 AM - Zealous: caught hacking
8:07 AM - Delay: fuck it, ban everyone that puts an effort into beating other players
8:07 AM - Mawr: Dunno man, i've been playing/hanging out with ali for a while now and he seems cool
8:07 AM - Zealous: you do know
8:07 AM - Mawr: >caught hacking
8:07 AM - Zealous: you're both shilling out of your ass
8:07 AM - Mawr: No evidence as usual?
8:07 AM - Delay: man, fuck this
8:07 AM - Delay: rave
8:07 AM - Zealous: there have been videos of this in v5
8:07 AM - Zealous: and v1
8:07 AM - Delay: obsidian thing in the doc
8:07 AM - Mawr: so much hacking, yet there has never been so much as a screenshot
8:08 AM - Zealous: and probablly other versions too
8:08 AM - Delay: maybe make a section for the modified defense thing
8:08 AM - Zealous: anyway we're getting off point
8:08 AM - Mawr: all these screenshots you are linking to
8:08 AM - Mawr: all the videos
8:08 AM - Zealous: fact is EVERY time /a/ will steamroll
8:08 AM - Zealous: and does steamroll
8:08 AM - Delay: just stop responding
8:08 AM - Zealous: and that won't change unless they are banned
8:08 AM - Zealous: just stop shilling
8:08 AM - Delay: he's too zealous to listen
8:08 AM - Mawr: >someone is better at me at game
8:08 AM - Mawr: >THEY HACK
8:08 AM - Delay: anway rave
8:08 AM - Mawr: >THEY MUST BE BANNED
8:08 AM - Delay: did you get what I sasid?
8:09 AM - Mawr: yeah im listening
8:09 AM - Mawr: hmm
8:09 AM - Delay: I guess you have a pretty good understanding of how it'd work
8:09 AM - Delay: there are different ways to handle the block tnt resistance
8:10 AM - Zealous: there are different ways to handle /a/
8:10 AM - Delay: the simplest should be to give all the building blocks an equal level of resistance
8:10 AM - Zealous: one of the ways is to ban them
8:10 AM - Zealous: and simplest
8:10 AM - Zealous: so let's do it
8:11 AM - Delay: alternatively we can give all blocks that level of resistance
8:11 AM - Delay: we can also make resistance levels vary
8:11 AM - Zealous: or we could just ban /a/
8:11 AM - Delay: like cobble is 2res, stone brick is 4
8:11 AM - Zealous: yeah let's do that
8:11 AM - Delay: etc
8:11 AM - Zealous: good idea
8:12 AM - Mawr: So remove the obsidian breaker thing in doc
8:12 AM - Mawr: And replace with a list of blocks and their resistances?
8:12 AM - Zealous: yeah just remove /a/
8:12 AM - Zealous: simple
8:12 AM - Delay: that works
8:12 AM - Zealous: thank you
8:12 AM - Delay: for now though just mention the idea
8:12 AM - Zealous: I have
8:12 AM - Mawr: no specific values, got it
8:13 AM - Zealous: and nobody has given me a decent reason why we shouldn't
8:13 AM - Mawr: resistance of 4 = need 4 blasts to destroy?
8:14 AM - Delay: yeah
8:14 AM - Delay: there might also be the matter of blast area to consider but that's for later
8:16 AM - Delay: Turn off creeper terrain damage, disable water from negating explosions, and raising balst resist of blocks in general but leaving them destructible. Increased tnt gains from crafting also work into the equation
8:17 AM - Delay: all that works together for the end result of making bases simpler to attack and defend
8:17 AM - Mawr: i put all of those suggestions in the discussion section
8:18 AM - Delay: it really has to be stated that they work together for a certain result
8:19 AM - Delay: can't expect people to figure it out themselves at first glance
8:19 AM - Zealous: B A N /A/
8:22 AM - Mawr: oh yeah for armor weight, where does gold armor go
8:22 AM - Mawr: what speed
8:22 AM - Mawr: and chain
8:28 AM - Dante disconnected.
8:29 AM - Dante entered chat.
8:34 AM - Delay: that has to be figured out
8:35 AM - Zealous: so when are we banning /a/
8:35 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (Delay)
8:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (Why not instead of making water do jack shit)
8:36 AM - Delay: yes?
8:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (you make sponges placeable)
8:36 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (fagot)
8:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (because that one is literally 3 more bytes in a config)
8:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (instead of a new plugin)
8:37 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (fagot)
8:38 AM - Delay: we'd still need to modify tnt resistances to make up for that anyway
8:38 AM - Mawr: placeable but not removable :?
8:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Theres not many sponges dude
8:38 AM - Delay: and the same plugin is also already being used to make obsidian breakable
8:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You'd need them to be removable
8:38 AM - Mawr: then its stupid
8:38 AM - Mawr: 2easy to scale walls and shit
8:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yes
8:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Use the 2 dozen rare items
8:38 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 2 dozen on the entire map
8:38 AM - Delay: why not make any one block placeable?
8:39 AM - Delay: you can fuck with water flow with it anyway
8:39 AM - Delay: if that's the purpose
8:39 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Because Sponge is made to fuck with water flow
8:39 AM - Mawr: if they are that rare then they wont be equivalent to removing water protecting from blasts
8:39 AM - Delay: and what we're thinking of makes water a non-issue
8:40 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Well Rave, Delay; I assume you've never seen a CDC in action?
8:41 AM - Delay: a what?
8:41 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: http://i.imgur.com/savv37j.png
8:41 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Continuous Detonation Cannon
8:41 AM - Delay: and you expected me to know what that was, how?
8:41 AM - Delay: how is it even supposed to work?
8:41 AM - Delay: and why bring it up?
8:42 AM - Delay: it make go boom boom many times
8:42 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Well normally with cannons theres a period in which you can mitigate damage
8:42 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's slow
8:42 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: CDC's can't be made hybrid, meaning useless against water
8:42 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But if you take water away
8:42 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
8:43 AM - Delay: and how does this affect the argument between using sponges and just disabling the water thing?
8:44 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Because using sponges at least means an additional step must be taken before using something like that cannon
8:44 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Also thats uhhhh
8:44 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 9 cannons, individually
8:44 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: In that picture
8:44 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: http://i.imgur.com/pEt7x7V.png
8:44 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats one shooting
8:45 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Gets about 5 TNT up in the air
8:45 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: At any one time
8:45 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I meant to burrow into the mountain, but it went over it
8:45 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kek
8:45 AM - Delay: how expensive is it to launch?
8:45 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 2 TNT to launch
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Meaning
8:46 AM - Delay: just the same as any other tnt
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
8:46 AM - Delay: *cannon
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That design is 2 TNT
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We can up the range
8:46 AM - Delay: just modify things
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Oh, it can't detonate at a fixed height/distance
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats one of the flaws
8:46 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Has to shoot the projectile right when the projectile comes out
8:47 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That particular cannon can go down to 5 tikcs
8:47 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: ticks*
8:47 AM - Delay: well I guess it's not that big of a deal
8:47 AM - Mawr: @zelaous https://archive.moe/vg/thread/73827769/#73901472
8:47 AM - Delay: increased tnt resistance in general would nerf it
8:47 AM - Delay: and it's neat
8:47 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That first picture was using an 8 tick timer IIRC
8:49 AM - Delay: I don't think the sponge thing is necessary
8:50 AM - Delay: if anything it heavily favors those who manage to find the sponges first and take them all
8:50 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Should be enough temples spread out to prevent that
8:50 AM - Delay: and whoever doesn't have any won't be able to take advantage of it
8:50 AM - Delay: the other method just makes it not matter
8:51 AM - Delay: it adds an unnecessary hole to jump through
8:51 AM - Delay: no
8:51 AM - Delay: shit I forgot the word
8:52 AM - Delay: annoying is the closest I got
8:53 AM - Delay: it'll end up being vital to breaching bases but at the same time it's a finite and rare block
8:53 AM - Delay: relatively rare
8:54 AM - Delay: the CDC isn't enough reason to let water negate explosions
8:55 AM - Zealous: oh shit guys
8:55 AM - Zealous: I just remembered
8:55 AM - Zealous: we should ban /a/
8:57 AM - Mawr: 16:47 - Mawr: @zelaous https://archive.moe/vg/thread/73827769/#73901472

9:14 AM - Delay: I don't get your argument
9:15 AM - Delay: the only difference is that you'd have to place sponges first
9:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
9:15 AM - Delay: making it that much difficult for everyone else to raid
9:15 AM - Delay: *much more
9:16 AM - Delay: then there's the primetime thing going on
9:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Whats fucky
9:16 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Is without water protection

9:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He wants to take water protection away entirely
9:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I recommended keep it but make sponges placeable
9:15 AM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So its nerfed but not removed
9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: >water prot gone

9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: retards
9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: holy hsit
9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: if thats the case i'll just do what /fit/ did in not 4craft
9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: and fill like
9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: 16 square chunkjs
9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: with water
9:16 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: up to height ceiling
9:17 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: gg

9:17 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: like
9:17 AM - DIN DO NUFFIN: how does this help the server

1:24 PM - Coty: thoughts?
1:24 PM - Zealous: go for it if you ban /a/
1:25 PM - Zealous: does sound cool though
1:25 PM - Zealous: maybe if it only works not in enemmy terrirory
1:25 PM - Zealous: or someone can go in with invs potion then tp everyone in
1:26 PM - Zealous: or enderpearl

1:27 PM - Gakthoil: sounds even better
1:27 PM - Mawr: Teleporters/waypoints are wayyy more interesting
1:27 PM - Zealous: why don't we have it so the ender can only be accessed during wartime too while we're at it

1:33 PM - Coty: also http://steamcommunity.com/groups/implyingyourgroupisbetter/discussions/0/617320628355874080/
1:36 PM - Pip: hap
1:36 PM - Rando: hey coty
1:36 PM - Rando: you should add in every rune :)
1:36 PM - Rando: it'll be so fun xD
1:37 PM - Coty: I wish
1:37 PM - ayy lmao: xD
1:37 PM - ayy lmao: xD
1:37 PM - Coty: a man can only dream so much before it starts to hurt
1:39 PM - Mawr: infinity in or out?
1:39 PM - D.J - Fred: in, but only gained from fishing pls
1:39 PM - Coty: its not like arrows are expensive
1:39 PM - Delay: sometimes you just gotta say "fuck it"
1:39 PM - Delay: in
1:40 PM - Pip: no infinity
1:40 PM - D.J - Fred: ayy
1:40 PM - Gakthoil: remove /a/rrows
1:40 PM - Delay: if infinity is out then we'll have to raise the max lvl of power enchant to make up for it
1:40 PM - Mawr: arrows are actually pretty annoying to get
1:40 PM - Gakthoil: that's why they need to be removed
1:40 PM - Mawr: just speaking from experience
1:42 PM - Delay: infinity on - power II 
infinity off - power III

1:48 PM - Coty: ?
1:48 PM - BroBuzz: hey
1:48 PM - Coty: ey bby
1:49 PM - BroBuzz: coty what's the point in implementing armor weight?
1:49 PM - Mawr: Simple, it actually makes choosing which armor type to use a thing
1:49 PM - Mawr: as opposed to
1:49 PM - Mawr: >hmm i wonder what  to use
1:50 PM - Mawr: >oh thats right, diamond is the best by far
1:50 PM - Mawr: The only consideration being the potential cost of losing it
1:50 PM - BroBuzz: but since diamond will still be the best defensive wise, everyone will still just use that
1:50 PM - ayy lmao: how about u remove diamonds again :^)
1:50 PM - Mawr: nope brobuzz
1:50 PM - Mawr: i know i wont
1:51 PM - BroBuzz: you're retarded then
1:51 PM - D.J - Fred: ayy
1:51 PM - BroBuzz: all this plugin is going to do is make eveyone slow as fuck.
1:51 PM - ayy lmao: ayy
1:51 PM - Delay: can't abort what you can't catch
1:51 PM - Pip: remove fun remove fun
1:51 PM - Mawr: well even if so, it still adds more depth
1:51 PM - Delay: hey, if they want to be slow as fuck to be tanky, it's their choice
1:51 PM - BroBuzz: It's not depth, it's pointless. When everyone is going to be using diamond all it's going to do is make shit slow.
1:52 PM - Delay: meanwhile I'll be cruising around in speedboosting leather shooting semen tipped arrows at people
1:52 PM - BroBuzz: Nobody will use Iron or the rest of that shit will the slow-ass diamondguys will be crushing everyone
1:52 PM - Mawr: >its not depth
1:53 PM - Mawr: It objectively makes non-diamond armor more viable
1:53 PM - Pip: leather archer reporting in
1:53 PM - Delay: tfw outrunning diamondfags in iron armor taking potshots
1:54 PM - Mawr: Also subtly adds a class system
1:54 PM - BroBuzz: Meanwhile they'll fucking tank everything and just kill you in 3 hits due to your shit armor
1:54 PM - BroBuzz: Diamond is so much better than the rest it's not even fun
1:54 PM - Mawr: >he doesnt understand the concept of
1:54 PM - Delay: tfw running past diamondfags to objectives because they're too hardcore to go fast
1:54 PM - Mawr: slow but powerful vs
1:55 PM - Mawr: fast and frail
1:55 PM - BroBuzz: That would be fine if minecraft was balanced, but this shit isn't.
1:55 PM - no: where is my healer role
1:55 PM - Mawr: It's like one of the most used balance techniques
1:55 PM - D.J - Fred: your weapon/bow is still going to do the same damage
1:55 PM - Delay: you be the guy running around throwing food at your allies
1:55 PM - Delay: leatherfags with diamond swords
1:56 PM - Delay: hit fast - kill fast
1:56 PM - Delay: *go fast - kill fast
1:56 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Diamond protects twice as well as Iron
1:56 PM - BroBuzz: That's the issue
1:56 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Includes Prot enchants, 1:1
1:56 PM - BroBuzz: Nobody will fucking use Iron when you get twice the defense with diamond gear
1:56 PM - Flinch entered chat.
1:57 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Prot 4 diamond blocks 96%, Prot 4 Iron blocks 92%
1:57 PM - Mawr: Then making diamond half the speed of iron would be the logical choice goy
1:57 PM - Mawr: probably too radical but eh
1:57 PM - D.J - Fred: people will be using iron, because they can't into getting diamonds
1:57 PM - BroBuzz: Then everyone will just be slow as fuck
1:57 PM - BroBuzz: It's not balance it's cumbersome bullshit
1:57 PM - Mawr: then up the normal speed
1:58 PM - Mawr: no armour = current speed
1:58 PM - Delay: and then he bitches about "you're just making EVERYONE slower by doing that beause they don't have the sense to use a different set of armor"
1:58 PM - Mawr: dia = slower
1:58 PM - Mawr: iron = faster
1:58 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Prot 2 Iron > Diamond though
1:58 PM - Mawr: leather = fastest
1:58 PM - D.J - Fred: what about gold
1:58 PM - Mawr: or dia = current speed
1:58 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Just like Prot 3 Iron > Prot 1 Diamond
1:58 PM - Mawr: dunno about that fred
1:58 PM - Mawr: up for discussion i guess
1:58 PM - BroBuzz: Nobody is going to want to use Iron or Leather when Diamond gives you twice the Defensive Power, even if they are faster.
1:58 PM - D.J - Fred: >tfw being the shiny warrior in gold armor
1:58 PM - BroBuzz: Everyone is going to go defensive because that's how PVP in minecraft works.
1:58 PM - D.J - Fred: ebin
1:58 PM - Coty: >super fast archer
1:59 PM - Coty: >slow diamond fag can't catch up
1:59 PM - Delay: what does defense matter if you can't hit anyone?
1:59 PM - Mawr: no YOU arent going to be using other armors
1:59 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >knockback sword
1:59 PM - Coty: did you even WATCH dragon ball z?
1:59 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kkek
1:59 PM - Delay: they'll just ignore you
1:59 PM - Mawr: you choice m8
1:59 PM - BroBuzz: >diamong fag uses bow
1:59 PM - BroBuzz: >archer dies in 2 hits due to their shit armor
1:59 PM - Delay: everyone else does too
1:59 PM - Coty: >he's to slow to dodge
1:59 PM - BroBuzz: Sure is balanced.
1:59 PM - Coty: >archer just runs around
1:59 PM - Delay: kek
1:59 PM - Pip: ok what if
1:59 PM - Pip: dont slow diamond
1:59 PM - Coty: into the trash
1:59 PM - Pip: but make leather faster
2:00 PM - BroBuzz: I'd be for that
2:00 PM - Delay: what about iron then?
2:00 PM - Mawr: i kinda said that already but ok
2:00 PM - Delay: eh?
2:00 PM - Mawr: slower than leather faster than dia
2:00 PM - BroBuzz: Iron can suck it
2:00 PM - Mawr: dia = current normal speed
2:00 PM - BroBuzz: Leather can but for archers and shit.
2:00 PM - Mawr: no armour = faster
2:00 PM - BroBuzz: *be
2:00 PM - Coty: I'm hoping for leather is 1.25x speed, gold being 1x speed, iron being .75x speed, diamond being .5x speed
2:00 PM - D.J - Fred: a-and muh gold armor pls
2:00 PM - Mawr: etc.
2:01 PM - BroBuzz: Coty what about Leather 1.75x Speed, Gold, Iron, and Diamond being 1x Speed
2:01 PM - Mawr: Alternatively dia - 100%, no armour - 125%, iron - 150%, leather - 200%
2:01 PM - Mawr: iron = diamond
2:01 PM - Coty: then it's just lame
2:01 PM - Mawr: top retard
2:01 PM - Coty: there's no point if you don't slow down the stronger stuff
2:01 PM - Pip: iron should not be rewarded
2:02 PM - Mawr: iron should be rewarded over diamond
2:02 PM - Mawr: pretty basic really
2:02 PM - Gakthoil: how would it scale with speed potions
2:02 PM - BroBuzz: But why slow the stronger stuff when all this is going to do is make archers viable?
2:02 PM - Mawr: slower - stronger
2:02 PM - Mawr: faster - weaker
2:02 PM - Coty: guys the real question is
2:02 PM - BroBuzz: If you want to add Archers just make Leather fast and don't fuck with the leather stuff.
2:02 PM - Coty: how would I write printf("a = %d\n", $s1); in 32 bit MIPs?
2:02 PM - BroBuzz: *other stuff
2:03 PM - Zealous left chat.
2:03 PM - Coty: not a single answer
2:04 PM - Coty: I'm dissapointed in you 4craft
2:04 PM - Mawr: :^)
2:04 PM - Delay: then the only choices will be leather or dia
2:04 PM - Delay: leaving out iron
2:04 PM - Mawr: fix your indentation and mixing tabs and spaces and we'll talk
2:04 PM - Delay: to rot in a corner
2:04 PM - BroBuzz: Iron can go fuck itself
2:04 PM - Delay: you can go fuck yourself
2:04 PM - Mawr: great argument brobuzz
2:04 PM - BroBuzz: k
2:04 PM - Pip: iron should be bad
2:04 PM - Delay: iron should be decent
2:04 PM - Coty: my vote is still for leather being fast, with stronger armor being scaled slower down to .5x speed
2:05 PM - Mawr: so dia would be how much?
2:05 PM - Coty: .5x
2:05 PM - Delay: .5x
2:05 PM - Coty: half as slow as normal speed
2:05 PM - Mawr: 50%? people will bitch
2:05 PM - Coty: it'd be like walking through soulsand
2:05 PM - Mawr: hell, ill bitch
2:05 PM - Coty: but all of the time
2:05 PM - Coty: maybe .75x then
2:05 PM - Mawr: sounds like shite
2:05 PM - Mawr: mabe
2:06 PM - Delay: leather can be 1.5, none 1.25, gold/iron 1x, dia 1.5
2:06 PM - Mawr: that i'd have to test to see
2:06 PM - Archevei entered chat.
2:06 PM - BroBuzz: I just don't see that point in that. All this is going to do is make Archers viable and make everyone else slow. Nobody is going to use Iron because Diamond gives you 2x the Defensive power. And if you want to make Archer Viable, just make Leather faster and don't fuck with the other armor sets.
2:06 PM - Pip: making nothing slower, only make things faster
2:06 PM - Mawr: Iron is going to be used though
2:06 PM - Coty: the point is to keep everyone from wearing diamond all of the time
2:06 PM - Mawr: watch the v5 raid vs /a/
2:07 PM - BroBuzz: Yeah those iron fags got killed increibly quickly
2:07 PM - Mawr: iron is used by the smaller factions too
2:07 PM - Delay: bro's mind can't grasp the concept of more than two options working
2:07 PM - Coty: yeah
2:07 PM - Pip: you want .50% for diamond and 1.25 for leather, instead you should have 1x for diamind and 2.25 for leather
2:07 PM - Coty: maybe we could also increase diamond by a bit
2:07 PM - Pip: that wont make people mad like 50 will
2:07 PM - Coty: like how that guy wrote a discussion thread about
2:07 PM - Mawr: 22:01 - Mawr: Alternatively dia - 100%, no armour - 125%, iron - 150%, leather - 200%
2:07 PM - Coty: to decrease the grinding
2:07 PM - Coty: increase rate of diamond ore in the earth I mean
2:07 PM - BroBuzz: I can grasp it but it's fucking pointless because everyone, besides archer fags, are going to gravitate towards Diamond Gear regardless.
2:08 PM - Mawr: so in other words, not everyone
2:08 PM - BroBuzz: I guarantee it.
2:08 PM - Coty: it'd also be viable to run up and attack and run off without being hit
2:08 PM - Delay: in other words, tankfags
2:08 PM - Coty: if you're fast enough
2:08 PM - Coty: increases the skill ceiling by quite a bit
2:08 PM - Gakthoil: make a poll guys :D
2:08 PM - Delay: you do the same amount of damage as well
2:08 PM - Delay: please don't
2:08 PM - Coty: maybe we could make defending actually mean something too, like right click to defend and actually negate most damage
2:09 PM - Delay: no polls
2:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: (Daily Reminder that speed potions are multiplicative)
2:09 PM - Delay: GO FAST
2:09 PM - Coty: sofast
2:09 PM - Coty: plus speed beacons
2:09 PM - Delay: MY DICK CAN'T TAKE THIS AIR RESISTANCE
2:09 PM - Delay: THE FRICTION IS SETTING IT ON FIRE
2:09 PM - Pip: we quake now
2:09 PM - Coty: you're now imagining sonic as a piece of bacon
2:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: nah Bacons use the same effect as Potions
2:10 PM - Coty: oh really? lame
2:10 PM - Delay: YFW BROBUZZ'S TEAM OF ELITE DIAFAGS WALK INTO YOUR BEACON SPEED BOOSTED BASE FILLED WITH LEATHERFAGS
2:10 PM - Mawr: yeah, beacons cancel potion effects last time i tried it
2:10 PM - Mawr: with quake fov
2:11 PM - BroBuzz: speed potions prove me shit even more. guys with diamond gear witll just bulk up on speed potions to get up to speed then.
2:11 PM - Pip: mfw i run faster than your arrow and shoot myself
2:11 PM - BroBuzz: making iron fags pointless
2:11 PM - Delay: speed pots are multipliers
2:11 PM - Delay: .5x2 vs 1x2
2:11 PM - Delay: 2slow
2:12 PM - BroBuzz: What's iron's speed gonna be?
2:12 PM - Delay: dunno
2:12 PM - Delay: but it'll be faster than dia
2:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 15.7136 m/s sprinting
2:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: With Leader + Speed
2:12 PM - Archevei: i hear this is where memes are born
2:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: lel
2:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Leather*
2:12 PM - BroBuzz: nobody is going to use iron because it's so much worse than diamond, that's my problem.
2:12 PM - Mawr: Might as well increase minecart speeds while we are at it
2:13 PM - Mawr: dont like it - dont use it
2:13 PM - Delay: but this will make that statement stop being true
2:13 PM - Mawr: you arent exactly being forced to use it
2:13 PM - Archevei: if memebuzz is being a crybabby about not being able to mine because you're a pleb
2:13 PM - Archevei: just nerf diamond generation higher
2:13 PM - BroBuzz: I'm cool with making Leather the "archer armor" and making it fast, but why nerf Diamond instead of just making leather faster?
2:13 PM - Flinch: because diamond needs to be nerfed
2:13 PM - Delay: listen to yourself
2:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Oh god
2:13 PM - Delay: "Diamond is the strongest so don't nerf it"
2:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Minecarts
2:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Move at 8m/s
2:14 PM - Archevei: if i remember correctly diamond generation was turned way down
2:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: oh gob.
2:14 PM - Pip: i will be nerfed if you make leather really fast
2:14 PM - Mawr: yep
2:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: OH GOB
2:14 PM - Archevei: i hope you remember how well that 4craft did :^)
2:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: THE AVERAGE HORSE IS 9.7m/s
2:14 PM - Delay: yfw sanic corps
2:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: AHHAHAHAHAH
2:14 PM - Pip: like make diamond 100% and leather 200% instead of diamond 50% and leather 100%
2:15 PM - Mawr: >tfw finding your first diamond on v3
2:15 PM - Archevei: /a/ will live on minecarts instead of an autism cube
2:15 PM - Pip: its the same ratio
2:15 PM - Pip: but wont make diamonds mad
2:15 PM - Archevei: we'll move too fast for you
2:15 PM - Delay: gorilla tactics
2:15 PM - Pip: diamond still nerfed
2:15 PM - Mawr: >only took 2 days of mining
2:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Boats are 4.8
2:15 PM - Mawr: Alternatively dia - 100%, no armour - 125%, iron - 150%, leather - 200%
2:15 PM - Flinch: you should be able to outrun diamond while wearing no armor
2:15 PM - BroBuzz: Mawr that was I've been saying
2:15 PM - Archevei: so you can be shot with a bow? :^)
2:15 PM - BroBuzz: *what
2:15 PM - D.J - Fred: give us prot 4 enchants :^)
2:15 PM - Delay: mawr, the speed pots will make things way too crazy if that happens
2:16 PM - BroBuzz: Don't fucking making everyone slow, just make everyone faster.
2:16 PM - Mawr: well, just turn down the speeds then delay
2:16 PM - BroBuzz: Exactly.
2:16 PM - Archevei: tl;dr make everyone faster
2:16 PM - Archevei: no armor is high
2:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: OH GOB YOU'D BE GOING 56.6 KPH
2:16 PM - Archevei: leather is sanic
2:16 PM - Mawr: dia - 100%, no armour - 120%, iron - 140%, leather - 160%
2:16 PM - Archevei: diamond is normal as of vanilla
2:16 PM - Archevei: and iron is a little higher
2:17 PM - Delay: well the end result is the same, balancewise
2:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 35 MPH
2:17 PM - Delay: but hot damn
2:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: YOU'D BE GOING AS FAST AS A CAR

2:17 PM - Delay: yes
2:17 PM - Mawr: remember, carrying 10 pots on you isnt exactly viable in 90% of cases

2:32 PM - Delay: you know that was the reason for the bedrock shitfest
2:32 PM - Mawr: a bit of bedrock cant possibly hurt can it huehue
2:32 PM - Coty: seriously though faction music would be neat
2:32 PM - Delay: it would
2:33 PM - Archevei: djinra stole that bedrock
2:33 PM - Delay: but only if the admins manage it
2:33 PM - Coty: bob did that last time right?
2:33 PM - Archevei: for your information
2:33 PM - Delay: not exactly
2:33 PM - Coty: I'll ask him how he did it
2:33 PM - Coty: later
2:33 PM - Teats: anyone know anything about what the map is gonna be?
2:33 PM - Delay: he bent over for the factions and gave them commandblocks covered in bedrock so they can play the mmusic themselves
2:33 PM - BroBuzz: something knew, probably.
2:33 PM - BroBuzz: *new
2:34 PM - Flinch: why, are you going to make a new map for us bro?
2:34 PM - Delay: then people who both knew about it and didn't threw a shitfit when they found /a/'s
2:35 PM - Teats: i dont like the new mc enchanting much
2:35 PM - Teats: enchant books until you see fortune III on a pickaxe
2:35 PM - BroBuzz: they change it recently?
2:36 PM - BroBuzz: I haven't played since last 4craft
2:36 PM - Teats: yeah. its lots different
2:36 PM - Delay: yeah
2:36 PM - Delay: not that much
2:36 PM - BroBuzz: less random?
2:36 PM - Delay: just gotta pay lapis as well now
2:36 PM - Teats: it shows you one of the enchants youll be getting
2:36 PM - Teats: and lvl 30 enchants only take 3 xp lvls
2:37 PM - Teats: but you still have to be 30 to do it
2:37 PM - BroBuzz: what happens if you go below level 30 while enchanting?
2:37 PM - Teats: you cant get lvl 30 enchants
2:38 PM - ☆☆ tpopz :3 left chat.
2:38 PM - BroBuzz: so now you should get to like level 40/50 then just enchant level 30s until you're below 30?
2:39 PM - Teats: yep
2:39 PM - Teats: thats a good point
2:39 PM - Delay: another thing
2:39 PM - BroBuzz: and what about lapis now? how did they involve that?
2:39 PM - Delay: SPAWNERS
2:40 PM - Teats: 3 lapis for lvl 30 enchants
2:40 PM - Teats: its still kinda useless
2:40 PM - BroBuzz: so you have to pay 3 lapis and 3 xp levels to get a level 30 enchant?
2:41 PM - Teats: yep
2:41 PM - Teats: its neat. but i like the old way better.
2:41 PM - BroBuzz: eh
2:42 PM - BroBuzz: The lapis shit is stupid but I like that it's signficently less random and grindy.
2:42 PM - Mawr: you also need more exp to get to level 30
2:42 PM - BroBuzz: how much more?
2:42 PM - Teats: im surprised more 4crafters dont actually play mc
2:42 PM - Mawr: you also cannot keep tools forever anymore
2:42 PM - Mawr: cannot repair them forever to be more specific
2:42 PM - Teats: WHAT
2:42 PM - Teats: that i didnt know
2:42 PM - Mawr: look it up if you want details nigger
2:43 PM - D.J - Fred: ayy
2:43 PM - Mawr: you can only repair any item like 5 times
2:43 PM - Teats: that sucks. ill look into it
2:43 PM - Delay: 4craft is a casual project
2:44 PM - Delay: it's supposed to be easy for casual players to keep up
2:44 PM - Delay: and that's for both attacking and defending to bearable degrees
2:44 PM - Delay: during wars
2:44 PM - Teats: im pretty sure there isnt a person in /a/ who isnt familiar with mc. is that why they always win?
2:45 PM - Delay: there are people
2:45 PM - BroBuzz: they win because they're the most autistic
2:45 PM - Delay: they win because they have the most people with the highest skillz
2:45 PM - BroBuzz: 4craft is a contest of who can out-autism everyone else.
2:45 PM - int disconnected.
2:45 PM - Delay: so we lower the autism cap
2:46 PM - Delay: making it easier to reach maximum autism
2:46 PM - Teats: i remember looking through /v/'s door and seeing a wall of heads. including mine. ;~;
2:49 PM - Teats: cant find anything on the repair limit. ill just go experiment myself
2:49 PM - Zemei: there was already a repairing limit
2:49 PM - Zemei: the cost went up each time until it was above the exp cap
2:49 PM - Teats: which is 40, rite?
2:49 PM - Zemei: yeah
2:50 PM - Teats: the only major change uis the rabbits. they made a big impact on the gameplay
2:50 PM - Mawr: nope zemai
2:51 PM - Mawr: zemei
2:51 PM - Teats: zempai
2:51 PM - Mawr: well, you needed to know the trick
2:51 PM - Zemei: the trick?
2:51 PM - Mawr: but that's /a/-only exploit
2:51 PM - Teats: kke
2:51 PM - Mawr: cant talk about it
2:51 PM - Mawr: /a/-exclusive so to speak
2:51 PM - Teats: haxx0r
2:51 PM - Zemei: is that related to the invincibility potions or the bedrock generator?
2:58 PM - Archevei: >lapis is now going to be the most sought-after ore
2:58 PM - Archevei: all according to plan :^)
2:59 PM - Archevei: djinra will steal the lapis
2:59 PM - Mawr: nah, lapis is still worthless

3:03 PM - Zemei: aren't those teleporters gonna use lapis?
3:04 PM - Mawr: you can use whatever you want for a key
3:06 PM - Delay: that's for runecraft teleporters
3:06 PM - Delay: tprune plugin teleporters use lapis blocks
3:06 PM - Mawr: oh, my bad
3:07 PM - Delay: outgoing and incoming, one uses lapis in a 3x3 X and the other uses redstone
3:07 PM - Delay: then you fill in the empty spaces in between with the code
3:08 PM - Delay: and that's it
3:08 PM - Delay: the codes work the same way as runecraft tp
3:08 PM - Delay: and by default it costs exp to use based on distance traveled
3:08 PM - Delay: but you can easisy reconfigure it to be free
3:08 PM - Delay: *easily
3:12 PM - Delay: I rather use it than runecraft's

3:28 PM - Delay: but it's easy enough to sit like that if you rest the sides sticking out right next to you
3:29 PM - Zemei: it's not comfortable if yuo do it exactly like that but it's comfy if you do it with feet pointing more downward
3:29 PM - Mawr: fun is kinda allowed

3:32 PM - Delay: it's easy enough if you don't spread open your lower legs
3:32 PM - Zemei: exactly
3:32 PM - Delay: but spreading them just fucks over your joints

6:38 PM - Rando: here it comes
6:38 PM - Rando: here's the "WHERES YOUR 4CRAFT THEN HUH?"
6:38 PM - Rando: argument
6:38 PM - Teats: kay it was me and lexsym vs you and sadisticstever
6:38 PM - Mawr: ah, so at the very beginning of the fight
6:39 PM - Mawr: were you one of the people chasing me when i was underwater?
6:39 PM - Zemei: traincarts when
6:39 PM - Teats: no lol. it was after that
6:39 PM - Delay: honestly, anyone can start up 4craft if they really want to bother managing it
6:39 PM - Teats: well yeah i was there chasing you
6:39 PM - Delay: that's what happened in v5
6:39 PM - Teats: nothing accomplished there
6:40 PM - Mawr: werent you suprised i managed to stay underwater for so long?
6:40 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: http://i.imgur.com/EdZ6TVc.gifv
6:40 PM - Teats: no, i assumed you had respiration or some shit
6:40 PM - Rando: who's this mawr guy ingame anyways?
6:40 PM - Delay: the resources are available and if your plan is sound and you hype it well enough you can even get people to donate for the server
6:40 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Rave_
6:40 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Why
6:40 PM - Mawr: mm
6:40 PM - Delay: it's even better if you pay for the server yourself
6:41 PM - D.J - Fred: who is this mawr? :^))
6:41 PM - Rando: oh ok
6:41 PM - Rando: that's like
6:41 PM - Mawr: who is this rave_ you are talking about
6:41 PM - Stross /x/ entered chat.
6:41 PM - Rando: the one guy that was always online
6:41 PM - Rando: even when there was like 4 players
6:41 PM - Mawr: fug muh autism is getting exposed
6:41 PM - Rando: well I mean
6:41 PM - Rando: you're in a 4chan chat with an anime girl avatar
6:41 PM - Rando: it was already out in the open
6:41 PM - Mawr: :3
6:42 PM - Rando: like a penis on a prairie
6:42 PM - Mawr: wanna e~r~p?
6:42 PM - Rando: like a black guy at an opera
6:42 PM - Teats: GAH this clusterfuck of a raid.
6:42 PM - Mawr: >raid
6:42 PM - Teats: i hope they use ts next time at least
6:42 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: They did
6:42 PM - Rando: how often does /a/ hold group ERP sessions?
6:42 PM - Mawr: the only reason you had a chance at killing someone was because we came out
6:42 PM - Flinch entered chat.
6:43 PM - Mawr: did you have a plan in case we didnt come out?
6:44 PM - Teats: we didnt expect anyone to come out
6:44 PM - Teats: nor did we know you knew
6:46 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dbR2JZmlWo
6:47 PM - Stross /x/: Filthyfrank is so funny /b/rother
6:47 PM - Stross /x/: :^)
6:47 PM - Flinch: so how does 3d claiming work with /f map
6:47 PM - Coty: same way ogres work
6:47 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Only shows horizontal slice you're in
6:48 PM - Delay: dirt pillare yourself up to /f map the next layer
6:48 PM - Delay: *pillar
6:48 PM - Flinch: so you can't find subterranean claims without serious effort anymore
6:48 PM - Coty: exactly
6:48 PM - Delay: you think a notification when you move up a layer would be useful?
6:49 PM - Coty: I think it'd get annoying
6:49 PM - Coty: honestly
6:49 PM - Delay: I guess
6:49 PM - Coty: coincidentally the sea layer is at y:64
6:49 PM - Coty: which is a multiple of 16
6:49 PM - Delay: ;)
6:49 PM - Coty: so when you're moving around the map you're constantly going between two layers
6:50 PM - Coty: I'm hoping this doesn't prove annoying as fuck when actually playing and trying to claim land
6:50 PM - Coty: but I have yet to see a big server using the plugin so I can't say for sure
6:50 PM - Archevei: i lel
6:50 PM - Archevei: invisible autismcubes underground now
6:50 PM - Archevei: great going kob
6:50 PM - Archevei: e
6:51 PM - Flinch: don't worry, you can still xray them
6:51 PM - D.J - Fred: ayyy
6:51 PM - Zemei: what if autoclaim mode claimed both the layer your head and your feet are in
6:52 PM - Delay: about the underground base thing
6:53 PM - Delay: would it be possible to just do something like "scanning" in a cube around you for claimed territory?
6:53 PM - Mawr: just have /f map display two maps - one in 2d and one with just the layer you are standing on
6:53 PM - Delay: with a command and just receiving a notification saying whether or not there's one nearby?
6:54 PM - Zemei: just the layer you're standing on would be 2D
6:54 PM - Tomato: what's even the point of 3d claiming
6:55 PM - Stross /x/: I feel 3d claiming is just going to make shit more annoying
6:55 PM - Stross /x/: Don't really see the point at all
6:56 PM - Zemei: you could have a super tall base confined to a smaller area
6:56 PM - Zemei: or a very flat one that spans more
6:56 PM - Coty: 3d claiming could be disabled in the plugin if we wanted (I made it a config option), but I'm really wanting to use it in 4craft
6:56 PM - Coty: you could do something like have a hidden underground city, or a sky base that isn't impossible to raid
6:56 PM - Coty: I don't like the idea of running around with /f map on and just scanning for faction land
6:57 PM - Stross /x/: So do you have to stack up if you want to claim a higher area or
6:57 PM - Stross /x/: I'm kinda dum I don't know how this works right now
6:57 PM - Flinch: how much power can each person contribute
6:58 PM - Flinch: 10 as usual?
6:58 PM - Coty: the number is undecided
6:58 PM - Coty: I think the default I set to like 20 or something
6:58 PM - Coty: but it'll probably be increased by a lot
6:58 PM - Coty: because 3d claiming means a shitload more to claim
6:58 PM - Archevei: with a max meme power
6:58 PM - Coty: to be super secure
6:59 PM - Archevei: of 500
6:59 PM - Stross /x/: Personally I think the more dank memes you spam in chat the more power you should get
7:00 PM - Coty: I made a plugin that scans literally every thread on 8chan looking for "4craft" in the subject line
7:00 PM - Coty: maybe we could do something with that
7:00 PM - Coty: ideas?
7:01 PM - Zemei: shitpost in every thread about 4craft
7:01 PM - Delay: inb4 people seriously suggest balance breaking ideas
7:01 PM - Zemei: also gun mods
7:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: nukes
7:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: >balance breaking
7:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Runecraft
7:01 PM - Bob the Biscuit: :^)
7:02 PM - Coty: rip runes ;_;
7:02 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Vampires
7:02 PM - Zemei: or how about every faction gets magic powers based on how often 4craft is mentioned on their home board
7:02 PM - Stross /x/: I would win
7:02 PM - Stross /x/: I am the best shill possible
7:03 PM - Zemei: they get shittier the more it's mentioned
7:03 PM - D.J - Fred: can you make sponges placeable in enemy factions?
7:03 PM - Delay: tfw I just wanted to mess around with that
7:04 PM - Stross /x/ disconnected.
7:05 PM - Coty: I could do that fred
7:05 PM - Coty: by why?
7:06 PM - D.J - Fred: to fuck with underwater bases
7:07 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: uhhhh
7:08 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Coty
7:08 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You're going to have to increase power a bunch
7:08 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Or make chunks take less power
7:08 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Theres 16 chunklets per big chunk
7:08 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Meaning before you could claim 10 full chunks
7:08 PM - Delay: inb4 you expect to have the same amount
7:08 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Nah
7:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I expected 100-140
7:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: A decrease, but not... 20 chunks, jesus really?
7:09 PM - Coty: 20 chunks is the default for 2d claims atm
7:09 PM - Delay: 20 per person is not small
7:09 PM - Coty: 3d claims is off by default iirc
7:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Ok
7:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Can we call the mini chunks chunklets from now on
7:10 PM - Coty: I don't know if I'm going to make it the same though
7:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: the 3D ones
7:10 PM - Delay: 20 16x16x16 areas are not small
7:10 PM - Coty: I'm honestly expecting more like 30 - 40 power per person
7:10 PM - Coty: the point of having 3d claiming is you don't claim top to bottom
7:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Delay thats barely enough to claim from sky to ground
7:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
7:10 PM - Coty: see above
7:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: thats true
7:10 PM - Coty: I think it'll be interesting to see how people handle their more limited claims
7:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats why I figured say 10x was fine
7:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: but only 4x?
7:11 PM - Delay: a single person must be able to claim from sky to ground
7:12 PM - Delay: groups of people sharing power would also use less overall
7:12 PM - Delay: for one base
7:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I also think you're vastly underestimating the volume needed to claim a base here
7:12 PM - Coty: I personally believe that a single person should only be able to claim their small home and an area around it
7:12 PM - Coty: I don't want people claiming from bedrock to skybox
7:12 PM - Teats: ^
7:12 PM - Coty: that destroys the point of having 3d claims enabled at all
7:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: A 3x3x3 chunk base, which is pretty fuckin small
7:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Smaller than 4cis' cube
7:13 PM - Coty: yes
7:13 PM - Mawr: you really need a lot to claim a base
7:13 PM - Coty: for a single person
7:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But then theres TNT protection
7:13 PM - Flinch: you also have to remember that people dont spend their whole time at full power
7:13 PM - Coty: peacetime will make your base nearly invicible
7:13 PM - Coty: wartime making it really easy to break in
7:13 PM - Mawr: in v6 for instance the amount of available claims was small
7:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: To properly protect a 3x3x3 chunk base
7:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: you'll need something like...
7:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 200 chunks
7:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No joke
7:14 PM - Delay: what do you mean by 3x3x3?
7:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 3x3x3 chunklet base
7:14 PM - Stross /x/ entered chat.
7:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So 3D chunks
7:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 48x48x48 blocks
7:14 PM - Delay: you mean sky to bedrock?
7:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Nah dude
7:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats USING 3D claims
7:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And even then 200 will be sparse fucking protection
7:15 PM - Coty: to claim a 3x3x3 you literally do 3 times 3 times 3 I think
7:15 PM - Coty: so 27 power
7:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
7:15 PM - Coty: unless I'm retarded
7:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But then protection from cannons
7:15 PM - Mawr: thats the size of the base
7:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats the problem
7:15 PM - Flinch: you need a buffer
7:15 PM - Coty: so how many chunks of buffer?
7:15 PM - Flinch: or 2 or so chunks in all direction
7:15 PM - Stross /x/ left chat.
7:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: If you don't got a buffer you die in minutes
7:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Oh no Flinch, more than that
7:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Especially from above
7:16 PM - Coty: how much more?
7:16 PM - Coty: and why above?
7:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: TNT dropping
7:16 PM - Mawr: fuck, yeah
7:16 PM - Coty: which wouldn't be an issue in peacetime?
7:16 PM - Mawr: tnt dropping, oh fuck
7:16 PM - Coty: in wartime you should simply expect it at that point
7:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It'd be an issue in war time if you die in 3 minutes
7:16 PM - Flinch: you instantly lose your whole base in like 90 seconds
7:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Especially if water protection is disabled
7:16 PM - Coty: hm
7:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
7:17 PM - Coty: how should we deal with that then?
7:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Give more fucking power jesus
7:17 PM - Bob the Biscuit: kek so it would be, people could have that shit set up to blow in peacetime
7:17 PM - Coty: another solution, get creative
7:17 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name entered chat.
7:17 PM - Bob the Biscuit: second wartime hits it starts raining tnt
7:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You want to make it so 5 people can be able to maintain a bases claim by being active
7:17 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: >walletcraft
7:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Anything else than that, you kill bases
7:17 PM - Mawr: nah bob
7:17 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: too many crafts
7:17 PM - Flinch: "get creative" means "build your base at the height limit coty
7:17 PM - Flinch: that isnt a good solution
7:17 PM - Mawr: well
7:17 PM - Coty: no I odn't mean that
7:17 PM - Coty: I mean what can I do
7:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That or SCAMPs
7:17 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: need one single unified craft
7:17 PM - Coty: to make it so tnt dropping isn't an issue?
7:18 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Give people more fuckin claim room
7:18 PM - Kevin Robinson From School: hey coty
7:18 PM - Coty: More ideas than that
7:18 PM - Delay: give too much power and there's no chance in hell they'd lose enough power for it to matter
7:18 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: muh power
7:18 PM - Kevin Robinson From School: Why the fuck did you announce the server to be launched on december when you don't have the money to pay it off yet :^)
7:18 PM - Teats: coat the entire sky over someones base so lots of mobs spawn just to piss em off
7:18 PM - Flinch: when was the last time someone actually had their power drop below their claims from people being killed
7:18 PM - Mawr: v5
7:19 PM - Mawr: /pol/
7:19 PM - Coty: I announced an ETA
7:19 PM - Coty: not a specific date
7:19 PM - Mawr: didnt matter anyways, because overclaiming was broken :^)
7:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Kek
7:19 PM - Coty: we'll probably have the dosh by late december, and if not then 4craft will be kill
7:19 PM - Mawr: afair
7:19 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: >December
7:19 PM - Kevin Robinson From School: but why announce an eta if you don't even have the money yet
7:19 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: just dont go to Januray cause then its DOA
7:19 PM - Coty: because no one would get hype and crowdfund
7:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: In general the perfect number for it, is 5 active people required to maintain a base
7:20 PM - Coty: if we don't reach the date I'll just refund the donors and we'll try again in a few months
7:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats just how it'll roll
7:20 PM - Spaceballs The Profile Name: just viral on halfchan and 8chan
7:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Well Oan just dropped $25 for you Coty
7:21 PM - Coty: I got the notification on my phone, he's a bro :3c

7:21 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: da
7:21 PM - Coty: what would stop dropping?
7:22 PM - Coty: without breaking the game to much
7:22 PM - StruttingB4: have we crowdfunded monkeys?
7:22 PM - Delay: I wouldn't mind if this doesn't work out
7:22 PM - Delay: I'm in it for the theorycraft
7:22 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: I don't know, pull a TF2 and give a hat?
7:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: The best number I can give
7:22 PM - Stross /x/ entered chat.
7:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Is 5 people to claim 250 chunks, MINIMUM
7:22 PM - Coty: no I don't mean that
7:22 PM - Coty: I mean what could I program in
7:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Anything less than that and you'll fuck smaller factions
7:22 PM - Coty: to stop dropping
7:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You can't
7:23 PM - Coty: Maybe I could make it so that tnt won't drop from above or go up from below a faciton land
7:23 PM - Mawr: water doesnt stop it?
7:23 PM - Coty: from x amount of chunks
7:23 PM - StruttingB4: why
7:23 PM - StruttingB4: ?
7:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: thats retarded Coty
7:23 PM - StruttingB4: to hurt skyraiders?
7:23 PM - Delay: even if water stops it
7:23 PM - StruttingB4: skyraiders are cool
7:23 PM - StruttingB4: suck their dicks
7:23 PM - Coty: well so is having 250 power
7:23 PM - Delay: you can drop sand just as easily
7:23 PM - Mawr: strut, dropping tnt from above a base
7:23 PM - Mawr: since 3d claiming is a thing
7:24 PM - StruttingB4: ya a pretty cool thing
7:24 PM - StruttingB4: :)
7:24 PM - StruttingB4: I liked the v5 raid
7:24 PM - StruttingB4: lets do it again sometime
7:24 PM - Mawr: stob id
7:24 PM - StruttingB4: nog
7:24 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Minus the ass devastation at the end pls
7:24 PM - Mawr: tfw i was buttblasted you were able to drop lava/tnt/water from up there
7:24 PM - Mawr: that wasnt supposed to be in
7:24 PM - Archevei: tl;dr this 3d claiming setup is max retarded and will do nothing gametime aside from having everyone making underground autismcubes
7:24 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: Does this mean we have to rebuild the Dorf Fort?
7:25 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yes
7:25 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: I'll get my hardhat
7:25 PM - Delay: think it might be possible to force primed tnt to not fall unless launched by tnt?
7:25 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Where should we put the spear of destiny?
7:26 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: So force TNT cannons?
7:26 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: I like it
7:26 PM - Delay: pretty much
7:26 PM - Delay: if possible
7:26 PM - Delay: I doubt it'd be easy
7:26 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Delay, can I get in a server with you, I want to murder you
7:26 PM - Delay: or performance friendly
7:26 PM - Delay: I want you to choke on it
7:27 PM - Coty: 9:25 PM - Delay: think it might be possible to force primed tnt to not fall unless launched by tnt?
7:27 PM - Coty: I could probably do it
7:27 PM - Coty: and it'd be fine on performance
7:27 PM - Archevei left chat.
7:27 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Coty, you too
7:27 PM - Coty: it'd be a simple check to make sure direction isn't just "down"
7:27 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: I like the idea
7:27 PM - Coty: or make sure the velocity is higher than a certain amount

7:28 PM - Archevei: allah today
7:28 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: No, but I praised Helix
7:28 PM - Delay: think it might mess with tnt cannon timing?
7:28 PM - Coty: I mean if we can't think of a clever way around dropping tnt then I'll just disable 3d claims and we'll stick with 2d
7:28 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll: So close enough.
7:28 PM - Flinch: then you can just bounce it off a clime block piston
7:28 PM - Coty: but I really wnat 3d to work
7:28 PM - Flinch: slime*

8:41 PM - Flinch: $250, remember to donate now
8:43 PM - Centipede519 /a/: You would expect someone to have some NEETbux laying around to donate
8:43 PM - Flinch: everyone is expecting everyone else to give up their neetbux so that they don't have to
8:44 PM - Teats: id donate if i wasnt 12
8:45 PM - Stross /x/: If every person that's in the 4craft group gave one dollaroo it'd pay for the next 10 4crafts
8:45 PM - Bob the Biscuit: Why don't we pay it with the dank meems we generate

10:03 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Ummm
10:03 PM - Flinch: 14
10:03 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I think in total
10:03 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: YeAH
10:03 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: 14
10:04 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: And you know what we only had one invasdion and that was cause of some asshole breaking the doors
10:04 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll disconnected.
10:04 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: So I still stand by 14 doors
10:05 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: we would kill Flinch
10:05 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I mean
10:05 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Flinch you can be the guy who farms

10:05 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: <3
10:06 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: In the circle farms no less.
10:06 PM - Centipede519 /a/: tfw i haven't legitimately played since v1
10:07 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Oh v1 was grand wasnt it?
10:07 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: All the energies were there.  The monuments to autism were high in the sky.
10:07 PM - Al: :^)
10:08 PM - Centipede519 /a/: The monuments of autism in /a/ were quite the opposte of in the sky
10:08 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Same for /tg/
10:08 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember /v/ had their base outside the boundaries and then the admins cracked down on them and they all left, effectively killing like a huge chunk of the population
10:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: that was great
10:09 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Was that V1? They all blend togheter honoslty
10:09 PM - Centipede519 /a/: but first they were dealing with splinter factions and constant raids and everything
10:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That was beta
10:09 PM - Big Dosh entered chat.
10:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Splinter resolved itself by release
10:09 PM - Flinch: /v/ was a trainwreck in v1
10:09 PM - Big Dosh: Oh, there we go, found the actual room
10:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Jammku ceremonally commited sudoku
10:09 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I was part of /a/ since alpha
10:09 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: After the out of bounds thing
10:09 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: V didnt have civil war in V1
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Yeah they did
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: In Beta
10:10 PM - Centipede519 /a/: Didthey?
10:10 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Didthey?
10:10 PM - Al: i was /v/ v1 D:
10:10 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I thought it was more of a coup
10:10 PM - Big Dosh: I've been riding the any faction niche for like 3 4crafts now yo
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: what in the fuck
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 10:10 PM - Centipede519 /a/: Didthey?
10:10 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Didthey?
10:10 PM - Centipede519 /a/: the base on the japanese southern island thing
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: what in the fuck
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: You BOTH missed the space
10:10 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I never typed that
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: steam
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: why
10:10 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: why steam
10:10 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Magic dont question
10:10 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Only circles
10:10 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: ONLY CIRCLES MONKEY
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: But yeah
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Remember /tg/ hosted a /v/ splinter in Beta?
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Then the leader of that splinter backstabbed everyone when offered a moderator spot
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And said he hated /tg/
10:11 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I remeber we kept LIT alive in beta
10:11 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: On our stupid little island.
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: was sad meng
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We had the actual /v/
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: The big one was /v/olcano
10:11 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And was made after the /v/
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Oh god was that the V VOlcano war?
10:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: God its ben like 2 years
10:12 PM - Al: i rember ;_;
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: JESUS CHRIST
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: ITS BEEN
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: 2 years
10:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: no
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Fuck Im old
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: OLDDDDDDDDDDDDD
10:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Year and 7 months
10:12 PM - Flinch: 18 months ish
10:12 PM - Big Dosh: I miss /pol/ and the skybases
10:12 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember how /jp/ and us dealt with some group of people using /h/ as their host faction so they could fuck with them
10:12 PM - Big Dosh: Erryone stopped liking octavian
10:12 PM - Centipede519 /a/: and then we fucking destroyed their chunk
10:12 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Poeple liked octavian?
10:12 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >/h/'s invincible admin fortress
10:12 PM - Big Dosh: I was tight with him outside of the game
10:13 PM - Big Dosh: Then I got shafted from /pol/ from association
10:13 PM - Big Dosh: Thanks dante
10:13 PM - Flinch: pol is a disaster
10:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Octavian is a tyrant, but he was at least somewhat competent
10:13 PM - Flinch: every iteration they come to hate and dox their own leader
10:13 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Im recalling parts of my life that I spent WAY to much energy on.
10:13 PM - Flinch: then fall apart
10:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Oh, Durban apparently is the new Leader
10:13 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Velo is mad
10:13 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Beta they kept alive
10:13 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: And V1 kept alive for a decent bitr.
10:13 PM - Big Dosh: Oshit you mean my top nigga Velocir
10:13 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember I fell through a hole when raiding /h/ and died, causing everyone in Raidcall to go "OH SHIT SOMEONE JUST FELL! LET ME GO DOWN THERE TO SEE!" and like 3 people died because of it
10:13 PM - Big Dosh: I gotta get in touch
10:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Yeah Velo was trying to get leader
10:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And Durban got elected instead
10:14 PM - Big Dosh: hue
10:14 PM - Big Dosh: Why can't I ever bet on the winning horse
10:14 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Cause thats boring.
10:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Might be a meme though, the guy who said it is notorious for lying like that
10:14 PM - Flinch: nobody wins in /pol/ power struggles
10:14 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Nobody
10:14 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: /tg/ wins
10:14 PM - Centipede519 /a/: Then there was also the /a/ vs. /mlp/ beta raid where we created this autism staircase to penetrate their floating base and we nearly won
10:14 PM - Al: whare is mention of mlp
10:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Dude not even /tg/ wins
10:15 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Anyone else who /pol/ hates win.
10:15 PM - Al: o der
10:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's just
10:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Its sad dude
10:15 PM - Big Dosh: I ended up leading /pol/ at a couple of points
10:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's depressing to watch /pol/ do this to itself
10:15 PM - Big Dosh: I don't even browse it yo
10:15 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Yo
10:15 PM - Flinch: the worst part is that they never learn
10:15 PM - Big Dosh: i just buddies with some members
10:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I know ;-;
10:15 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Haven't learned once
10:15 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Its a horibble fate to see history repeat.
10:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Like my addiction to circle bases.
10:16 PM - Big Dosh: Y'know, that guy from /mlp/ drhorrorshow, he was always a pretty bro guy
10:16 PM - Big Dosh: ony or not, never had a bad thing to say bout him
10:16 PM - Big Dosh: *pony
10:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: MOst of us 4chaners are good guys.
10:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah, just neutral
10:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: goys
10:16 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: *
10:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Goys
10:16 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: And gols
10:16 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I find it funny how at least like 3 or 4 people from /a/ on 4craft ended up being bunched with /v/ on civcraft
10:17 PM - Big Dosh: I think I missed civcraft
10:17 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Oh did we actualy do civcraft?
10:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Some did
10:17 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I remeber hearing something about that
10:17 PM - Centipede519 /a/: Nope
10:17 PM - Centipede519 /a/: we did not all do it
10:17 PM - Zemei: what happened with that?
10:17 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: But never botherd with it.
10:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Remember Horrorshow had the highest bounty for awhile?
10:17 PM - Centipede519 /a/: Only /v/, /int/, /pol/ and /b/ did
10:17 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Civcraft always seemed way to circle jerky for me
10:17 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Faction wise
10:17 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
10:18 PM - Centipede519 /a/: So far /v/ has become the same thing as leddit cities, and /int/ is opening it's anus for reddit. /pol/ is doing it's own thing and /b/ is off and on for activity
10:18 PM - Big Dosh: I wonder if /asf/ will be back
10:18 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Hmmm might drop in to see whats up
10:18 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah it is
10:18 PM - Big Dosh: I remember hanging out with em all the time on ts
10:18 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: They still hate me though
10:18 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Which is sad
10:18 PM - Big Dosh: oh kaz was based as shit tho
10:18 PM - Flinch: has /asf/ ever managed to carry out a contract
10:18 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Wait does the leader of ASF still hate our guts?
10:18 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Kaz is nice and all, but he has some serious judgement issues
10:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
10:19 PM - Big Dosh: Well, they did successfully infiltrate /pol/
10:19 PM - Al: pol is ez
10:19 PM - Flinch: that isnt an achievement
10:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: no
10:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: no it isn't
10:19 PM - Centipede519 /a/: If all of us could get Protection IV armor on Civcraft, we'd be able to pretty much win the server
10:19 PM - Big Dosh: WELL THANKS FOR PISSING ON MY FIREWORKS
10:19 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: NO PROBLEM
10:19 PM - Big Dosh: I was being special
10:19 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: But whats the point?
10:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We actually have a bet we're trying to get going
10:19 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: If we win on civcraft I feel we would get a reset.
10:19 PM - Bob the Biscuit left chat.
10:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Where we try and get one of the councilmen into /pol/
10:19 PM - Big Dosh: Actually, none, I just like drifting from faction to faction
10:19 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: the 1.0 councilmen of /tg/
10:19 PM - Al: wat is this civcraft
10:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And see if they notice
10:20 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Woot
10:20 PM - Zemei: can I help beat up leddit
10:20 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I wonder if anyone none council persons know who the 1.0 council persons of /tg/ were
10:20 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I can remember half of them
10:20 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I would hope so
10:20 PM - Centipede519 /a/: The biggest problem the *Chan efforts in Civcraft faced were that none of us were willing to go to war because we wanted to hoard resources to build autism buildings
10:21 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: fuck who was that guy who left really early on
10:21 PM - Centipede519 /a/: that and the unwillingness to advertise
10:21 PM - Zemei: can't you do both with enough autism?
10:21 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: 4craft proved we like autism over usefull war.
10:21 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Had like a normalfag name
10:21 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Monkey I know
10:21 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Never came back
10:21 PM - Big Dosh: I swear /a/ were THE raiders at one point
10:22 PM - Flinch: /a/ raided the entire server in 2.0
10:22 PM - Centipede519 /a/: During v1 /a/ pretty much won from what I heard
10:22 PM - Big Dosh: no one remember that 4craft with the huge combined assault against them at their base?
10:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: v5?
10:22 PM - Big Dosh: with uh, thattree leading
10:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah I watched that
10:22 PM - Big Dosh: yeah, one of the more recent
10:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It was embarressing
10:22 PM - Centipede519 /a/: GOTTA GET READY TO DIE
10:22 PM - [VF4]Oan_Mkoll entered chat.
10:22 PM - Big Dosh: It was fun while we was there
10:22 PM - Zemei: the only losers in that battle were the ones leading the assault
10:22 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thattree is such an incompetent tactician that I'm surprised anyone is still listening to him
10:22 PM - Zemei: was a lot of fun
10:22 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I dont think /a/ and /tg/ other then at the nd of V1 really dicked around with eachother
10:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: 2.0
10:23 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Was it 2.0?
10:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: They blew a hole in our decoy
10:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: remember?
10:23 PM - Centipede519 /a/: the main thing with raids in small areas is that it's sort of hard to organize or figure things out. Especially if you don't know the insides of it
10:23 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Then raided ASF
10:23 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Wait was 2.0 the one hwer we scamped ourselves?
10:23 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Or was that 5?
10:23 PM - Zemei: well, knowing the inside wasn't the problem
10:23 PM - Big Dosh: I always thought sabotage was the big problem
10:23 PM - Zemei: actually blowing it open went hilariously badly
10:23 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I think we scamped ourselves after 2 atleast.
10:24 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That was v3, v5, and v6
10:24 PM - Zemei: like, the bridge and scaffolding?
10:24 PM - Zemei: great
10:24 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember /a/ tried to rebuild the geofront in v2
10:24 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Why must I forget all these amazing thigns
10:24 PM - Centipede519 /a/: and i got lazy and stopped playing
10:24 PM - Centipede519 /a/: then I came back for v4 but it seemed dead
10:24 PM - Zemei: dropping tnt to bust open the roof?
10:24 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Which one
10:25 PM - Zemei: should've just kept going instead of dropping in and getting blown up, sealed in, flooded, etc
10:25 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Was the semi sky map with islands?
10:25 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: God I just remeber no
10:25 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: No you stupid idiots didn't get rid of the water first
10:25 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It would've all went well if you removed every inch of water off the top of that
10:26 PM - Zemei: not even every inch, just like sand/gravel the blasting zone
10:26 PM - Zemei: would've been better than what we did
10:26 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Zemei you talking about the raid on A base?
10:26 PM - Zemei: yeah
10:26 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Or another attack?
10:26 PM - Al: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P-V4Ks7OE4&list=UU_f2iTJ-X_4far8W4qTSh1g
10:26 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I'm just wondering how we're going to manage to build an autistic and impenetrable base this time that we won't get a repeat
10:26 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I know the V1,2,3 mlp leaderhas some decent vids
10:26 PM - Zemei: I remember getting sealed inside the top floor because some chucklefuck poured lava
10:26 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I forget his channel though
10:27 PM - Centipede519 /a/: lol ASF guy going "4craft is pretty boring, no good way to raid people"
10:27 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: WAIT
10:27 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: THIS IS OUR BASE
10:27 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: <3
10:27 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Thank you al
10:28 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: THANK YOU thw all how I missed it
10:29 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Building that wall was a bitch.
10:29 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I think it scared off /k/ once
10:29 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: THE WALLLLLLL
10:29 PM - Al: muhwalls
10:29 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: SCI REMEBER THAT?
10:30 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: WHEN K ATTACKED AND THEN JUST TURNED AROUND
10:30 PM - Flinch: /v/
10:30 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: YEAH
10:30 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I saw that in chat
10:30 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: IT was K wasnt it?
10:30 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: was great
10:30 PM - Al: v was part of it
10:30 PM - Al: because i came when i was with v
10:30 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >i am the milkman
10:30 PM - Al: we lost some guys to fall damage and left
10:30 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: It wasnt that raid, but V was the only faction to actually get into V1 tg base actual.
10:30 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Yeah
10:30 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Treefarm
10:30 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember in v1 I went to /v/'s island to scout them with an invisible potion and I ended up running from like 3 people in diamond armor
10:31 PM - Zemei: http://www.burntweiners.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/spidey_wall.jpg
10:31 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Not treefarm
10:31 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: V1 actual version actual TG base
10:31 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Shit I don't remember that one
10:31 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Someone broke the iron
10:31 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I was thinking the one with the spy
10:31 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: .... wouldn't they get trapped if they jumped down
10:31 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kek
10:31 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Yeah your thinking of beta fort.
10:32 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: No like someone during week 2 or something broke some inner walls and iron doors.
10:32 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: V raiding team diamond iron mix of like I think 7 dudes attacked us. We had maybe 9 guys but no diamond.  So we just dug from above and belove used lava and chased them out.
10:32 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I tihnk they lose like 3 dudes to our 1? I cant actaully recall. Always wanted to know who dug the damn walls out
10:33 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Man
10:33 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: v1 was fun because of the enchant bug
10:33 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: V1 was fun cause none of us were bitter
10:33 PM - Al: the smelting ore?
10:33 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: true
10:33 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: lel
10:33 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah

10:34 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember /v/ raided us one time and most of us had diamond/iron mix and we all huddled into our Geofront entry building and tried to lure them into entering. They all ended up leaving because they knew we'd never leave
10:34 PM - Al: there were exploits just about every version
10:34 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Sci never forget V3 base and its horror.
10:34 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I feel /v/ raiding parties were either hit or miss.
10:34 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: It's not my fault Zodd was autisming out front and I had no plan
10:34 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: YES IT WAS
10:34 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: YOU WERE THE DESIGNER
10:34 PM - Al: centipede, do you also remember when i would come by to harass your faction daily?
10:35 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I think?
10:35 PM - Centipede519 /a/: There were a lot of people who tried to harass us and /jp/
10:35 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Zodd said he had a plan
10:35 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: never shared it
10:35 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: ;-;
10:35 PM - Al: i don't think any of them ever were quite as persistent as i was
10:35 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Monkey you dont get to build bases after V3 we learned our lesson
10:36 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember in beta, there was a guy named "moonstone" that kept on trying to fuck with us
10:36 PM - Centipede519 /a/: and we got the admins to disable home setting because of it
10:36 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Not without a plan
10:36 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Q.Q
10:36 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: ;-;
10:36 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Homesetting never forget the OP that let us not have stairs going up

10:38 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Id like to see the surface atleast once a week maybe
10:38 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I went kinda stircrazy with digging.
10:38 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Remember v5's dome?
10:38 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: YES
10:38 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: That wthing was aamzing
10:38 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I wish we could have the numbers to build that thing again
10:38 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Tht took what like 40 people?
10:38 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
10:39 PM - Centipede519 /a/: AllisterDood will not die in that video
10:39 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Allister dood is broken
10:39 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Lets not even start with that
10:40 PM - Zemei: after things started dying down in v5 I was adding more themed floors to the skybase
10:40 PM - Zemei: who else would come along when there's a hole in our roof but AlisterDood
10:40 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: lel
10:40 PM - Zemei: didn't even see him build that cobble staircase
10:40 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He was like that
10:40 PM - Flinch: rip
10:40 PM - Al: :^)
10:41 PM - Flinch: is djinra playing this round?
10:41 PM - Zemei: I managed to knock him off but he waterbucketed to safety
10:41 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: nah
10:41 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Djinra is still alive?
10:41 PM - Zemei: and not without him setting fire to the entire interior
10:42 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: ueaj
10:42 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah*
10:42 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I just want to experience the autism raids again
10:42 PM - Flinch: how will /a/ be able to wreck the server without djinra
10:42 PM - Al: i'm hoping /a/'s overwhelming advantage in proficient faction members is a little less this time around
10:42 PM - Al: i even bothered to resign at the end of v6
10:42 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: kek
10:43 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: How was v6?
10:43 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I didnt bother
10:43 PM - Zemei: short-lived
10:43 PM - Al: was boring
10:43 PM - Zemei: turtley
10:43 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: V6 came to soon after v5 so I was tired
10:43 PM - Flinch: dem dcamps
10:43 PM - Flinch: scamps*
10:43 PM - Flinch: so many
10:43 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So Alister, who you rolling with now anyways
10:43 PM - Al: idk
10:43 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Said something like leading your own
10:43 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I'm pretty sure Allister was in Civcraft
10:43 PM - Zemei: /out/ was so defensible we didn't even get visitors
10:43 PM - Flinch: roll with pol, whip them into shape
10:43 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: KEK
10:44 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: yeah
10:44 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: nah
10:44 PM - Al: probably gonna have my own faction and just my alts
10:44 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: /x/ probably needs it more
10:44 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: /lit/ Could always use love
10:44 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: All 4 of them
10:44 PM - Al: XD no one trusts me
10:44 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Remember when they killed /pol/?
10:44 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That was sad
10:44 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Al nos hit no one trusts you.
10:44 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: You somehow have godmode
10:45 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: WEre the fucking mooks to your gorden freeman.
10:45 PM - Centipede519 /a/: I remember one of /jp/'s people, Kovio once went to /pol/ and killed multiple of them in one of the early versions
10:45 PM - Al: ): i need love too
10:45 PM - Zemei: join /out/, make us a superpower
10:45 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Al I love you in the way I love the sun.
10:45 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We'd probably let you into /tg/, but we don't attack unless attacked first
10:45 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: So you'd go stir crazy
10:45 PM - Al: ya
10:46 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: You could help us dig out 3x3 chunks
10:46 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Like we always do
10:46 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: That helps keep the stir craze
10:46 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: That and all the salt peter
10:46 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He'll start trying to critjump blocks
10:46 PM - Al: when i'm not fighting, i'm finding exploits :^)
10:46 PM - Centipede519 /a/: tfw i have a fuckton of games to play but the idea of playing minecraft is more exciting to me
10:47 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >you guys kill Cryostat in the video
10:47 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: lel
10:47 PM - Flinch: you could honestly start /v/ without anyone from /v/ realising
10:47 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Is getting ducktape and using it on your mouse an eploit for mining?
10:47 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Nah I think he's over /v/
10:47 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Cause it totally is.
10:47 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: He was in it originally remember?
10:47 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Al wernt you in A first?
10:47 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: There was this whole drama
10:47 PM - Flinch: infinite retards to order around
10:47 PM - Al: nope
10:47 PM - Al: started as a merc faction in beta
10:47 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: I remeber fighting you on MLP when I invisidicked near the end of V1
10:47 PM - Al: no one recognized me until i killed a v splinter faction
10:47 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Your ass saw me anyway.
10:48 PM - Al: then joined v ironically
10:48 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Oh shit remember Oceania Flinch?
10:48 PM - Al: went on to fight mlp in beta and v1
10:48 PM - Flinch: yes

10:48 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: That was the first time I became aware of how OP enchantments were
10:48 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: No hablo ingles senor.
10:49 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Was when I was on the /tg/ walls in the Beta
10:49 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: And got one shot by an arrow in diamond
10:49 PM - Al: oh yeah, it was incredible how no one else had prot 4 and golden apples in v1
10:49 PM - StruttingB4 left chat.
10:49 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Beta was such a cluster fuck.
10:49 PM - Al: rambo was made possible because of ignorant autists
10:49 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Im hoping the amount of terrorism is less this server.
10:49 PM - Centipede519 /a/: Beta was fun. If only someone got that /a/ vs. /mlp/ raid recorded
10:49 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We actually began exporting Prot 4 for diamonds
10:49 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: As /sci/
10:50 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I came up with a script to do the EXP exploit automatically
10:50 PM - Al: lal
10:50 PM - Al: who does the mining for all the ores doe
10:50 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Potatos
10:50 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Cough cough.
10:50 PM - Al: ah
10:50 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Had a Fortune pick we used to harvest them
10:50 PM - Al: yeah i wasn't patient for being a farmer
10:50 PM - Al: didn't even think of using those
10:50 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We made like... 50 sets in two days?
10:51 PM - Zemei: should get a fortune sword
10:51 PM - Al: did you not raid with all those sets?
10:51 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: We raided /x/ a few times
10:51 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Thats it
10:51 PM - Al: ._.
10:51 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: /sci/ was four dudes in an obsidian penis
10:52 PM - Flinch: no homo
10:52 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Total homo
10:52 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Dont lie
10:52 PM - H.I.Jinxy /tg/: Hey you think coty is gona make sky bridges around our base again?
10:54 PM - Zemei: >have the smallest island in the game
10:54 PM - Zemei: >coty's skybridge cuts directly over it
10:55 PM - Zemei: t-thanks
10:55 PM - Flinch: every time he logged off we destroyed them, then he built them again as soon as he came back
10:55 PM - Al: is pol still divided
10:56 PM - Zemei: is that even a question
10:56 PM - Al: i remember them being a formidable opponent at one point
10:56 PM - Flinch: pol is a disaster, they have already had a major drama between dante and velo, then between velo and durban
10:56 PM - Flinch: and it hasnt even started yet
10:56 PM - Al: /a/ lost a skirmish to pol in one version
10:56 PM - Centipede519 /a/: wasn't that v5
10:57 PM - Al: it was in the nether and we fought between territories
10:58 PM - Al: in my opinion, they had the most potential to beat /a/ at that point
10:58 PM - Centipede519 /a/: Oh fuck I just forgot that at the end of the beta, like everyone went to /b/'s island and made some kind of cool base in celebration. Regardless of faction
10:59 PM - Flinch: remember that time you guys murdered /asf/ while they were on a contract to help you
11:00 PM - Al: that was v6 right
11:00 PM - /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: v2
11:00 PM - Flinch: 2
11:01 PM - Zemei: p classy
11:01 PM - Al: who was the faction that helped us against delayed and his army of exploited prot 3 armor
11:01 PM - Al: cause i remember we turned on them after killing delayed
11:03 PM - Al: and no, i can't recall the turn we did on asf in v2. might have not been on for that one

6:44 AM - Dante: >diamond slowing you down is retarded
6:44 AM - Dante: fuck off
6:44 AM - Zealous: I'm not even butthurt, just bored and it annoys them
6:45 AM - Arturiel: kek Dante, it's fucking retarded because why would you even wear it if it's been nerfed?
6:46 AM - Zealous: because it's still strong
6:46 AM - Arturiel: but it's not
6:46 AM - Zealous: but it is
6:46 AM - Arturiel: if you're slow you're just going to get hit more often
6:46 AM - Arturiel: and get rekt
6:46 AM - Arturiel: the best thing about diamond is the fact that it just reduces your damage enough so that you'd regen when you run away
6:46 AM - Zealous: but it does less damage per hit, so it evens out :^)
6:46 AM - Dante: it is stronker
6:47 AM - Arturiel: it's not, if you can't kite with it
6:47 AM - Zealous: pros and cons
6:47 AM - Zealous: instead of just pros
6:47 AM - Arturiel: the fucking cons is that it's hard as fuck to come by
6:47 AM - Arturiel: especially if you're dying a lot
6:47 AM - Zealous: well then don't die allot
6:47 AM - Zealous: problem solved

6:50 AM - int: i can hear your cheeky lel from across the ocean m8
6:50 AM - Zealous: it makes defenders harder to kill
6:50 AM - Arturiel: literally the only good thing about diamond is that when you're kiting you're not taking enough damage that your regen wont solve
6:50 AM - Zealous: becuase attackers will have to use the faster armour
6:50 AM - Zealous: so it's actually nerf to /a/ and you know it
6:50 AM - Arturiel: no, the faster armour will still get rekt by 2 swings with a diamond sword
6:51 AM - Arturiel: there is no benefit to any of this
6:51 AM - Zealous: but there is
6:51 AM - Dante: its best when you have no armor ;^)
