[12:33 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Man this is autistic
[12:33 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: But fun, I guess.
[12:34 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Nah, shitposting isn't fun, it's a grind.
[12:34 PM] /mlp/ Jep: But it's with a purpose. ;^)

[12:35 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: So boys
[12:35 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: How equal are we gonna get?
[12:35 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Not very equal it seems, since according to monkey horror will still be leader, and I don't think he's a commie.
[12:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Tbqh fuck the retarded "hiarchy" shit, you guys can do your own thing
[12:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Have fun dying to /a/ again though
[12:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Not my problemo, I try to solve yours & you tards' all say 'noooo, it's impossssibblee' (to organize people)
[12:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Not really, you're just all tards.
[12:37 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Im just used to being a loser
[12:37 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: So i dont really give a shit
[12:37 PM] /mlp/ Finch: yo so when this starts are we going to be using the discord that purple meme man can listen in on or do we have an actual working TS somewhere
[12:38 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I don't mean you, really, fap. I mean Finch, Gatler specifically, and Marshmellow
[12:38 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Did somebody say...
[12:38 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Go do your own thing, I won't get in your way
[12:38 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: EQUAL?
[12:38 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: 

[12:39 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Bit late glim
[12:39 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: But better than never
[12:39 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: We have 16 people in this Discord & not a single one can listen to the other, fucking hell. More just ranting at Gatler & Finch but whatever.
[12:39 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Fuck this bullshit, have fun.
[12:39 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Am doing college and discord at same time
[12:39 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: is hard fam
[12:39 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: If I could get the admin to move me to a /k/ group I would(edited)
[12:39 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Except he's retarded as well
[12:40 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Why not just form a splinter cell inside of /mlp/ where we actually get our shit done
[12:40 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I'd do that with you Jep & Meme except you won't be here, so it'd just be us three
[12:40 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Perhaps we just need to MAKE MLP GREAT AGAIN
[12:40 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Which would be pointless
[12:40 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Should I revamp the /mlp/craft server to be our personal creative test lab where we do shit with tnt cannons and create better walls?
[12:41 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: It wouldn't be pointless
[12:41 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Sure jep sure
[12:41 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: During my absence you guys can gather resources, intel, formulate plans and shit, etc(edited)
[12:41 PM] /mlp/ Jep: N-not that I own the /mlp/craft server or anything
[12:41 PM] /mlp/ Jep: N-no op.
[12:41 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: But i usually just do that shit offline
[12:41 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: No point, we're not going to raid anyone or use tnt cannons because these people are goddamn tards who can't basically organize
[12:41 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: It's not a hard concept
[12:41 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: It's not difficult to grasp
[12:41 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: So fuck them
[12:42 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Anyone willing to get shit done and be organized join the splinter cell
[12:42 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: The rest tard around with the rest of /mlp/
[12:42 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I mean, did you see v5 base? It was a 3-high cobble wall
[12:42 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Inb4 we have 7 different cellsin /mlp/
[12:42 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Real nice, retards
[12:42 PM] /mlp/ Jep: People who would be willing to get shit done wouldn't want to work some tards who can't be arsed though.
[12:42 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Inb4 civil war
[12:43 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Also, >DrHorror, kill yourself.(edited)
[12:43 PM] /mlp/ Jep: 

[12:43 PM] /mlp/ Jep: This.
[12:44 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Here's how I imagine it going down
[12:44 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: We have the /mlp/ faction
[12:44 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: And two seperate groups in the faction
[12:44 PM] /mlp/ Jep: And nobody gets shit done.
[12:44 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: One is the tards
[12:44 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: One is us(edited)
[12:44 PM] /mlp/ Jep: >dividing our ressources
[12:44 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Already a great plan.
[12:45 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Better than nothing Jep
[12:45 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: No, no fanciful ""imagining" and predicting, we don't say shit until we get into the game, this is all 100% fullproof retardation, all of you shut the hell up
[12:45 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Your stupid planning is worthless(edited)
[12:45 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Get into the game
[12:45 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Decide from there
[12:45 PM] /mlp/ Jep: I miss when we just posted pones. ;-;
[12:46 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Shit, I miss when humans had fucking brains and could organize, and not act like literal fucking tribes of autistic gorillas
[12:46 PM] /mlp/ Jep: I like how we are both reddit and mlp, such multicultural.
[12:47 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Those days are long gone cristo
[12:47 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: All choices in life are shite black and white choices
[12:47 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Apparently so.
[12:48 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Honestly if I get into the game there's no way in hell I'm working with Drhorror or half of these braindead retards
[12:48 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: So who is hosting this time round
[12:49 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: So if it's a >>>mlp civil war whatever
[12:49 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I just know that
[12:49 PM] /mlp/ Finch: this your first 4craft, cristo?
[12:50 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Just please stop talking Finch, you act like you know it all yet when you show us videos of you autistic monkeys trying to >>>raid shit you can't tell right from left
[12:50 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: I sense some tension
[12:50 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: And you already know the answer, you've already asked before
[12:50 PM] /mlp/ Finch: im not in a single one of those videos m8, i never pvp
[12:51 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Fuck off Monkey, don't even bother
[12:51 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: No one wants to hear your trademarked bullshit(edited)
[12:53 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Things seem a bit heated
[12:53 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Let's lower the temperature
[12:53 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: >when you instigate an mlp civil war by dunking on an autist

[12:54 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Fuck off Monkey, don't even bother
No one wants to hear your trademarked bullshit
[12:54 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: You're an epic memer, you know that
[12:54 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Just the best
[12:54 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Were deffinitely not gonna get anywhere with these reddit memes
[12:55 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Monkey fuck off
[12:55 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Go back to >>>general and shitpost there
[12:55 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: You want us to stop shitting up general, stop shitting up pone
[1:06 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Oh shit this channel is being used

[1:09 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: So is it possible to get elcted if your not /mlp/
[1:09 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Id like to put in my nomination
[1:09 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I like all the horses
[1:09 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Except Rarity
[1:09 PM] /mlp/ Jep: It's not possible to get elected at all apparantly, it's just whoever has the most autistic privllege and feel most like being the leader
[1:10 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Oh IMTHE MOST AUTISTIC
[1:10 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: I DIG MEMES FOR A LIVING
[1:10 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: No joke
[1:10 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Fun times
[1:10 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Something we've been trying to change, except no one here has half a brain cell & can organize
[1:10 PM] /mlp/ Jep: I literally spammed reddit shit for like an hour. I fucking dare you to compare autism.
[1:10 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Literally. Just. Fucking. Get. Into. Groups
[1:10 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: ITS NOT HARD
[1:10 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Why not just
[1:10 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Y'know
[1:10 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Vote
[1:10 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Because oldfags want to stay in power
[1:10 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Because the oldfags don't want that
[1:11 PM] /mlp/ Finch: prove it can be done cristo. make a new discord, a whitelist document, a recruitment process, a document with a general gameplan and a series of roles and jobs for people
[1:11 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Becauase oldfags who suck at the game don't want /mlp/ to succeed.
[1:11 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: >oldfags
kek, nobody should give a shit what we think(edited)
[1:11 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: THat bird persons idea is dumb
[1:11 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Just do a demoracy
[1:11 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Finch, you want me to document this shit? And if I'll do it you'll actually consider it? Well, that's mighty easy because that's been what I've been suggesting this entire fucking time.
[1:11 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: You people should have faith in the people
[1:11 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: SURPRISE HUH
[1:12 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Not some odd police state of no trust of your citizens
[1:12 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: >inb4 civil war
[1:12 PM] /mlp/ Finch: i always mine and farm to support the other people, i can follow instructions
[1:12 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Democracy is fucking retarded, but it might work if we democratically elect a dictator.
[1:12 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: YOu want pure democracy elected by the people my friends.
[1:12 PM] /mlp/ Finch: it just never works out that enough people do
[1:12 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: The idea of making a white list is just wrong.
[1:12 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: That. Is. The. Problem.
[1:12 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: People cannot organize
[1:12 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Because they are too stupid
[1:12 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: That is what I'm saying
[1:13 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Well get better clay
[1:13 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: I was rep last iteration
[1:13 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Didnt even get on
[1:13 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Let the stupids jack off while the rest of us in the /mlp/ get shit done and use them as cannon fodder. And if it gets too bad we civil war
[1:13 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Shows how good the selection is
[1:13 PM] /mlp/ Jep: This is assuming the retards aren't the ones leading us though Glim.
[1:13 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Just make two divisions; the people who want to have a system, and the shit people
[1:13 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Don't follow their orders.
[1:13 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Aka DrHorror
[1:14 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: That's the plan right now, Manhorse
[1:14 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Alright, so we have /mlp/ and /mlpol/.
[1:14 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Might work.
[1:14 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: What is DrHorror gonna do? Kick out half of the faction?
[1:14 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Also, speaking from experience, the oldfags fucking suck. I've been here since v1/v2 and I'm still disappointed
[1:14 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Also @/mlp/ Jep  like hitler
[1:14 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Not according to the oldfags :^^^^))
[1:14 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: kek
[1:14 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Manhorse
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: What was V1 base
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: And where was it
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: For you guys
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: If your ACTUALLY v1
[1:15 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: The oldfags try to justify their shittiness by saying they're good it's just because yea because uh yeah
[1:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Get rid of Gatler, get rid of DrHorror, get rid of anyone who ignores orders
[1:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Etc.
[1:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Yeah, what Glim just said
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Depends where you were
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Manhorse
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I mean /mlp/craft v1
[1:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: They're better in their mind because they're older, except they're still SHIT(edited)
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: I meant 4craft V1
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: OH
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: No
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Not your intcraft 4chab halfbreed server
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ Jep: >w-we have done this for years
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: uwot
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Ive BEEN on those things
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: I was in mlpcraft v1
[1:15 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: ITs bby mode m8
[1:15 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Doesn't matter they have always been shit at it.
[1:16 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I've been in every /mlp/craft if that counts
[1:16 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I remember when XDA1 was cool
[1:16 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: NOthing has yet to counter t
[1:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: ITs also nice to see /mlp/ be active
[1:22 PM] /mlp/ Jep: We need to gas /mlp/
[1:22 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I'd rather let this thing crash and burn, take the loot, then make my own fac with anyone who isn't autistic
[1:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Its a change of pace
[1:22 PM] /mlp/ Jep: But only the retards.
[1:22 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Is /mlp/ usually not this lively?
[1:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: It goes in cycles
[1:22 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: CIVIL WAR
[1:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: V1 was HUGE as fuck
[1:22 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: We've tried before, but there are half-retards and quarter-retards and it's too complex to gas
[1:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: V5 was preety big
[1:22 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Yea, well that's because the oldfags just know what they are fucking doing so they don't have to communicate like us newfags-(edited)
[1:23 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Its more tied in with how active /mlp/ IRL is
[1:23 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: You'd expect a faction centered around a children's show about technicolor horses having adventures and friendship would be more lively and open to suggestions
[1:23 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Kek, messed that up.
[1:23 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Why do we need a leader anyway
[1:23 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Because /pol/ tries the whole no leader thing
[1:23 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: By having EVERYONE be leader
[1:23 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Organization, three-step hiarchy
[1:23 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Why not a council of people if you insist on a heirarchy
[1:23 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: And it ends up so well.
[1:23 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Except that's no longer a thing
[1:23 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: [1:18 PM] /mlp/ Cristo: I will give you that Finch, I didn't believe you when you told me Monkey was an autistic slimey peice of shit(edited)
[1:23 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: tbh
[1:23 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: horrorshow has been rused by me before
[1:23 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Nice snooping
[1:24 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: so he's biased
[1:24 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Fuck off please
[1:24 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: kek
[1:24 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Look, I said please.
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ Jep: If we have a c ouncil shit won't happen.
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ Jep: We will need one leader who isn't shit.
[1:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Thats not true at all.
[1:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Councils CAN work
[1:24 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: HiJanxy is best purple
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Shit will happen slowly on it's own
[1:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: If you get comptent people in them
[1:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Its the whole competent poeple bit
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: We need less autists who focus on power
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ Jep: We are being raided, let's vote on what we should do xD
[1:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Thats the whole issue.
[1:24 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Councils put more of a very small population into a position of power rather than a position of production(edited)
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: More who just get shit done
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Nooo, Charles voted twice, this is not fair. ;^(
[1:24 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Even in individual parties; however, there will be people who will take all the cool shit for "muh defense"
[1:25 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: And then build shitty cobble towers
[1:25 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Yeah you do councils and just assign roles via that council with one person being the First among equals
[1:25 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: direct democracy doesn't work, democracy does
[1:25 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Well direct demorcacy IRL works in small very smalls ituations
[1:25 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Neato Monkey, no one cares and Jep, Glim & I sure aren't listening
[1:25 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Fuck off
[1:25 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Direct democracy is shit
[1:25 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Let's elect a dictator
[1:25 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: LIke under 30 people bands
[1:25 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Democracy is still shit
[1:25 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: A flat hiarchy won't work
[1:25 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: BUt at that point your at proto communism.
[1:26 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: We need a dictator
[1:26 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: I nominate french
[1:26 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Just make sure youhave the framework to kick said dictator
[1:26 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Are you sure Frenchie can run a faction that large
[1:26 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Sure he's a good player, but as a leader of so many?
[1:26 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Elect a dictator who is good at leading, cares about who he is leading, can plan out effective strategies, and isn't retarded or a shitbag.
[1:26 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Well just have an uprising if the dictator is shite
[1:27 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Honestly, I say we split off into a /k/ group or something & take all the competent people with us
[1:27 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Well no such person exists in here.
[1:27 PM] /mlp/ Jep: So we might as well fucking give up.
[1:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: WEll all the /boards/ exist
[1:27 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Me and french have led factions before
[1:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: So if you wanna exodus
[1:27 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: In mlpcraft
[1:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Your gona havet o knock knock on their door
[1:27 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Why don't we just /mlk/ or /mlpol/ or something
[1:27 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I mean, if we take Fap, Jep, Glim, French, Manhorse, etc.
[1:27 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: If you remember auschwitz(edited)
[1:27 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: :^) thx fam
[1:27 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: /mlk/ or /mlpol/ would be nice
[1:28 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Yea, I have run factions with over 200 mebers controlling entire servers, but anybody can fucking do that.
[1:28 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: /mlk/ pls, I don't want to be associated with /pol/
[1:28 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Personally, /pol/ is heavy-duty pvp, but it's a shit board
[1:28 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: martin luther king board confirmed
[1:28 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: A shit board to play with at least
[1:28 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: kek
[1:28 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: /k/ would be the best to function with
[1:28 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: /mlk/ confirm
[1:28 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: /k/ also has a legacy of being not shit
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Look, look. Right now. We split off. Take the competent & active people with us, and we'll do much better.
[1:29 PM] /mlp/ Finch: you what
[1:29 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Now we just need to find a hero we need but dont deserve
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Let's just say /mlk/, right.
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Let's do it
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Don't dawdle
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Rightn ow
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Do it
[1:29 PM] /mlp/ Finch: /k/ literally failed to win a raid from inside the storeroom
[1:29 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Alright, admins can you move all of the mlk fags out of here?
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Make /mlk/ containment channel pls
[1:29 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I nominate XDA1 as the leader of The /mlp/eme Team
[1:29 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Kek
[1:29 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Good luck to them
[1:29 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: >changing my name
[1:30 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Please
[1:30 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: I nominate myself as eternal glorious dictator for life.... After I return from my cruise
[1:30 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: They will deffinitely need it
[1:30 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: I guess ill be the faction's bitch?
[1:30 PM] /mlp/ Jep: No that would be really retarded, if you can't be here from the beginning you shouldn't be leader, then people will have gotten used to temp leader by then.
[1:30 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: @/mlp/ Jep is /mlk/ too
[1:30 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Im fine with being a bitch
[1:30 PM] /mlp/ Jep: No.
[1:30 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: No?
[1:31 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Yes
[1:31 PM] /mlp/ Jep: I said I wouldn't go k.
[1:31 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: To be honest, we don't need a strong buff minmax leader
[1:31 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: We just need a guy who can think
[1:31 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: We're not  /k/
[1:31 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: We're /mlk/
[1:31 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: This has nothing to do with /k/
[1:31 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Alright, that sucks Jep.
[1:31 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Still retarded, we got a ton of ressources here, we should atleast see what we could do with it before makking our own thing.
[1:31 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: It's more of a separration
[1:32 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: No point jep
[1:32 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: A leader doesn't need to be the best at PvP, he needs to be able to recognize which of whom he leads is best at PvP, and lead his armies effectively
[1:32 PM] /mlp/ Finch: tbh the most important quality for a leader is the ability to filter out who gets invited. a raid is less devastating than 1 dumbass with a lava bucket
[1:32 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Also admin please /mlk/ only chat channel
[1:32 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: man this is just like /pol/ in v6 tbh
[1:32 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: We're technically seperate
[1:32 PM] /mlp/ Finch: let crisco do it
[1:32 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: then both split offs sucked
[1:32 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: The definition of insanity is doing something multiple times expecting change
[1:32 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: And we were insane
[1:32 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: We're doing this differently
[1:32 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: It wasnt working and will not
[1:32 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: New thing now
[1:32 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: ILl make
[1:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: A temp thing for you fags
[1:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: For now
[1:33 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I think, personally, it would be extremely inefficient and would fuck us all to split off into two
[1:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Name it the 4 horsemens of the ponyapopockpse
[1:33 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Not really, you're thinking others will do anything
[1:33 PM] /mlp/ Jep: I agree Manhorse.
[1:33 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: >4 horsemens
manhorses*
[1:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: No
[1:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: 4 horsememes
[1:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: There we go
[1:33 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: We're splitting because they won't
[1:33 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: We're not splitting at all
[1:33 PM] /mlp/ Jep: mlpexit
[1:34 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I mean technically we are, in a sense of leadership
[1:34 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Wait, what do the oldfags want to do for a leader?
[1:34 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: DrHorror
[1:34 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Because 'he always has been'
[1:34 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: How's he at leading?
[1:34 PM] /mlp/ Finch: fuck horror
[1:34 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Shit
[1:34 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: kek no he hasn't
[1:34 PM] /mlp/ Jep: DrHorror has stepped down, I would put my chips on gettting a newfag elected leader.
[1:34 PM] /mlp/ Jep: But we could always just leave as soon as we are meeting opposition.
[1:35 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Since when did horror step down?
[1:35 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Oi
[1:35 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: So
[1:35 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Today
[1:35 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Look, /mlp/ is the opposite of sturdy. We need the person with the least experience in 4craft and the most experience in Minecraft, probably.
[1:35 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: WHo wants temp titles
[1:35 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >leave as soon as we are meeting opposition
[1:35 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Or perms anyway
[1:35 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Ill take one
[1:35 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: >temp

[1:35 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Yeah me too
[1:35 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Wow, real winner talk there.
[1:36 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Exactly.
[1:36 PM] /mlp/ Jep: This is so degenerate.
[1:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: How?
[1:36 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: The way I see it; oldfags can get shit on, we outvote their need to not vote(edited)
[1:36 PM] /mlp/ Jep: You are acting like children and pretending it's a political move.
[1:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Not really.
[1:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: We don't like the leaders.
[1:36 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Therefor we will not operate under them
[1:36 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Woah hold on I don't want to pick sides between /mlk/ and /mlp/
[1:36 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: You don't know the leaders
[1:37 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: You fucking shit
[1:37 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Really
[1:37 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Exactly, let's see what we can work with before splitting off.
[1:37 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I am the undecided horsefucker
[1:37 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: I like /mlk/ because memes, but I say we see how things go before just leaving right away
[1:37 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Atleast somebody has a brain.

[1:47 PM] /mlp/ Finch: the most effective leadership for 4craft is one leader who nobody hates that does nothing but tell people who are good at things to do those things. but that only works if you have people that fit those criteria which we havent since 2013
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Let's not hit caps lock here, we can figure something out without screaming like this
[1:48 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: I would be in voicechat except you guys can't
[1:48 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: So
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Even if /mlp/ should be controlled by one person, what would be a list of acceptable candidates?
[1:48 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: I'm sure one of us is a capable leader, Finch
[1:48 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: You guys could try and elect /tg/
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: No, you wanna be in voice chat so you can talk over people.
[1:48 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: WE are good at managing factions
[1:48 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Might work better
[1:48 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Nice strawman insult Anthony
[1:48 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Think of it like hiring a new CEO
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Jep: I don't think anybody here is a capeable leader.
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Finch: you guys are good at manipulating more like
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Strawman?
[1:48 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Not even going to bother continuning this "conversation"
[1:48 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Hey
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Ad hominem bitch.
[1:48 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: ...I can get behind electing /tg/
[1:48 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Whats goverment if not manipulation of the poeple?

[1:49 PM] /mlp/ NoWolfie: Goodnight

[1:49 PM] /mlp/ Finch: it ended poorly
[1:49 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: OH beta

[1:49 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Vote Jinxy for /mlp/ leadership
[1:50 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: I can fake it till I make it for your pony memes
[1:50 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: That's like making a nigger president of America. And you saw how that turned out
[1:50 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Wait, how do you plan to fix the issues /mlp/ has if you're elected
[1:50 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Well first off ID figure outw hose actually competent

[1:52 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Food isn't exactly hard to come by in minecraft.

[2:24 PM] /mlp/ Jep: If everybody is going to be special snowflake head of something anyways  we might as well all be leaders.
[2:24 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Kek
[2:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: RElaly though
[2:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Is a stable
[2:24 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Maybe(edited)
[2:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Horse prsion
[2:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Someone tell me
[2:24 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Porn for morale
[2:24 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Or is it like a horse house
[2:24 PM] /mlp/ Finch: the knacker's yard
[2:24 PM] /mlp/ Jep: According to the canon of the show, it's a dungeon, or a hell dimension.
[2:24 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Well
[2:24 PM] /mlp/ Jep: It depends how bad you are.
[2:24 PM] /mlk/ GlimGlam: Can the horse open the door to the stable
[2:24 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: I just want to make it clear, what ever kind of votes you guys are holding are not for the leadership of the /mlp/ faction proper. Our previous 4craft leadership will not be changing.
[2:25 PM] /mlp/ Jep: Then we just make neomlp.
[2:25 PM] /mlp/ Finch: your previous leader said "fuck you guys" and isnt playing
[2:25 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
[2:25 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: no
[2:25 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: No
[2:25 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: Its being voted on
[2:25 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: And its happening
[2:26 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: If you feel otherwise then please fuck off
[2:28 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: your vote means nothing, if you don't like our leadership then you can form your own seperate faction with your own leadership.
[2:31 PM] /mlp/ Garry: who #Janxy here, again?
[2:31 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I want to offer ya a leadership position
[2:31 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: o.o
[2:31 PM] /mlp/ Jep: What sort of position?
[2:32 PM] /trash/ Dam Son: whats up
[2:32 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: I already told you guys last night that the leadership will stay the same, if any of you can prove yourself to us then you can become an officer, but you are not leading the faction.

[3:44 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: he is
[3:44 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: so far as I see it
[3:44 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Ok
[3:44 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Who keeps deleting shit
[3:44 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: JEsus
[3:44 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: theres a guy who got elected
[3:44 PM] /mlp/ Garry: the server didn't start yet
[3:44 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: and he's leader
[3:44 PM] /mlp/ Garry: and the /mlp/ community voted for me
[3:45 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Last time I checked, leadership wasnt chosen by saying ME FIRST
[3:45 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: That we did
[3:45 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: no they didn't, the /mlp/ community is not the dozen peopl who are here right now.
[3:45 PM] /mlp/ Garry: oldfags, newfags, bullshit. I am an oldfag. My co-leaders will probably be newfags. We're all /mlp/, nothing else.
[3:45 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: actually it is Garry
[3:45 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Im gona say make a forum post or someshit
[3:46 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Or use steam
[3:46 PM] /mlp/ Garry: /mlp/ does not agree. Marsh.
[3:46 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: no one's even consulted /mlp/ though
[3:46 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Look, I'm trying to smooth things out here.
[3:46 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: dude there was an entire vote
[3:46 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: did you miss that?
[3:46 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Yeah, even /mlk/ joined up.
[3:46 PM] /mlp/ Finch: the people here are /mlp/ as far as 4craft goes
[3:46 PM] /mlp/ Finch: and you got outvoted
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Finch: jinxy, move mallow to the splinter mlp
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: /mlp/ is not a democracy
[3:47 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: PFFT
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I am not stealing your power, I am offering you to be by my side.
[3:47 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: No can do. Marshmellows faction has historical claims
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Where everyone else is.
[3:47 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: ANd popu,ation behind it
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Finch: historical doesnt mean anything, its might makes right
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: >historical claims
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Finch: he has 2 people
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Reminder that you guys majority voted for Garry and are now bitching about it
[3:47 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: >population behind it
[3:48 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Garry has become the new leader, get over it
[3:48 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: >2
I told you there are like at least 2 dozen people who will come out of the woodwork when 4craft begins
[3:48 PM] /mlp/ Garry: No way, the plan has to be made now
[3:48 PM] /mlp/ Garry: We can't wait for them to pop up and get lost
[3:48 PM] /mlp/ Finch: if they show up late to the vote it sucks to be them
[3:48 PM] /mlp/ Finch: no vote
[3:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: We have numbers, plans, everything.
[3:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: If they show up, it's better they show up to a working faction
[3:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: and not just... three guys.
[3:49 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: What's the current plan we're deciding on? I've been popping in and out.
[3:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: you're in separate discord, right?
[3:50 PM] /mlp/ Garry: We had quite the discussion
[3:50 PM] /mlp/ Garry: This here chat is compromised by external commenters, so we moved stuff there.
fug1
[3:50 PM] /mlp/ Garry: And I'd like all who remain here to join us there.
[3:50 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Ah, of course.
[3:50 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I would agree with that.
[3:51 PM] /mlp/ Garry: @/mlp/ Drhorrorshow @/mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole @/mlp/ Anthuny If you want to have leadership roles in this system, please head over to the discord and fill out the form.
[3:51 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: If you want to be allowed in the faction at all, cut this shit out and get in line.
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Garry: No way, man, it's too late for threats.
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >threats
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Finch: pretty sure anthuny isnt getting a faction invite
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Stick with me while I'mm doing diplomacy.
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Garry.
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: We are in line, you're the one naysaying it
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Go fuck yourself.
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Garry: What's wrong with you?
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Anthuny please, you're going to end up fucking yourself here
[3:52 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I know you have experience, so I want you with me on this, why do you have to act like that?
[3:53 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: @/mlp/ look, far as I can tell Garry is /mlp/ leader, he won a vote, horrorshow 2 votes vs his 12
[3:53 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Glimglam had 7
🐒2
[3:54 PM] /mlp/ Finch: admin man
[3:54 PM] /mlp/ Finch: admin them out
[3:54 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: if garry wants them removed, he can ask me to remove them
[3:54 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: he controls the roster as of now
[3:54 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Join me, guys, I don't want this to get ugly.
[3:54 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: gg no re
[3:54 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Accept it or get left out in the Wilderness
[3:54 PM] /mlp/ Garry: It's pointless powerplay, let us just go to victory together.
[3:55 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: So much for not making threats?
[3:55 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I'm not a diplomat, I'm just the guy who helped the uprising
[3:56 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Yeah, no threats.
[3:56 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I just want you to stay with mlp under my leadership and not break away
[3:56 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >not break away
[3:56 PM] /mlp/ Garry: if you quit from mlp, I can't have you here since opsec.
[3:56 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: You're the breakaway.
[3:56 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: And you're wrong.
[3:56 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: he's not a breakaway tbh
[3:56 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: See, there was a vote that was passed
[3:57 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: the guy played in v2 and v3 iirc
[3:57 PM] /mlp/ Garry: /mlp/ just decided not to use your assistance as leaders and chose me. That's not breakaway.
[3:57 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: You not agreeing doesn't mean things change

[4:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: No. You will lead nobody.
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: No it doesn't Marshmellow
[4:15 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: either that or you leave
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: That is our point
[4:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Not with that attitude.
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Are you any good at it?
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: We have already left
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Already left
[4:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: No. We're leaving nowhere.
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: You ahve no one
[4:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: We're MLP. We are in control.
[4:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Are you with us?
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: United we stand, divided we fall
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: You are the minority now
[4:15 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: You are not the leaders
[4:16 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: You are the ones that agree or leave
[4:16 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Not us
[4:16 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: This is precisely what I predicted would happen
[4:16 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Meme where did I see that before
[4:16 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: I dunno
[4:16 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: 'United we stand, divided we fall'
[4:16 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: I dunno, it's from something
[4:16 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: I'm not shitting I saw that in a commercial or something a month or so ago
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Sounds like something from 40k maybe
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Who knows
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Well, the idea stands
[4:17 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Not 40k
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We will get nowhere if people keep struggling over power like it's a trophy
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: You need to purge this CoD mindset
[4:17 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: that's why we go with the status quo
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Hah
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Why
[4:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: It isn't about you, it's about the greater good
[4:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Marshmallow, your status quo guy wasn't speaking much
[4:18 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Let me just as you why
[4:18 PM] /mlp/ Garry: are you sure he's still in?
[4:18 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Why do you want to do the same thing
[4:18 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Again
[4:18 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Why
[4:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: The status quo is clearly just sitting in a corner and wacking plants
[4:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We can either die hiding in a corner, or gloriously in the fields of combat
[4:18 PM] /mlk/ Cristo: Or possibly not at all
[4:18 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: Why would I speak much in a discord whos
[4:27 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Military experience would be more useful
[4:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Id like to add
[4:27 PM] /mlp/ Garry: So you might want to join me while you still can get leadership spots
[4:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: That you can get a foreign CEO
[4:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: To lead your faction
[4:27 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: Oy vey
[4:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Its not unheard of for corporte structures
[4:27 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Hell, even reading loads of tactical manuals
[4:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: /tg/ is here for your administartion needs
[4:27 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: We export fine admins
[4:27 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We just need someone capable, and experience != capability
[4:28 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: well the last few iterations /mlp/ have been rather capable kek
[4:28 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: In terms of leadership at least
[4:28 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: Rapture never got fucked until post /a/ in V5
[4:28 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Yeah, but how much of that is just overwhelming force?
[4:28 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: IIRC /mlp/ were secure in a scamped abomination in V6
[4:28 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Ahahahahaha
[4:29 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: V6
[4:29 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: That was the best
[4:29 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: The time when every played like /tg/
[4:29 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Is security lots of fun? Is hiding in a box fun?
[4:29 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Works for /tg/
[4:29 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: no meme marine
[4:29 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: having your base safe
[4:29 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: The king of boxs
[4:29 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: is fun
[4:29 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: after pvping
[4:29 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: and returning to your base still there
[4:29 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: You can havs a safe base AND attack others
[4:29 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: is fun
[4:29 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Is getting anally raped fun Meme?
[4:29 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: Look the only thing we are arguing here is who gets to lead the faction named "/mlp/". We already claim trhe right to lead that faction, if you are unsatisfied with how we do things you can splinter off and we can still be allies if you want.
[4:29 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: v6 they only lived because the cannon /a/ built malfunctioned in specific coordinates
[4:29 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: https://a.pomf.cat/qycckp.jpg

[4:29 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: because mineman is a reliable game
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Garry: splitting /mlp/ is pointless
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: No, splitting would end all this bullshit.
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Garry: but letting 3 people run the show when nobody wants them is even more pointless
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: then why are you trying to split everyone apart then?
[4:30 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: well they have a group of 101 people that I can see
[4:30 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Drhorror
[4:30 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: IS that for YOUR game?
[4:30 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: even if just a fraction mobilise
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Garry: your claim to /mlp/ brings nothing
[4:30 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Or for our base
[4:30 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: they have more than you
[4:30 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: WHERE IS THAT MEME FROM
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: Oh no
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: I think it was Holmir
[4:30 PM] /mlp/ Finch: they dont count unless they actually do show up
[4:30 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: ye
[4:30 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: and even if 20 show up
[4:30 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: it's more than here
[4:31 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: They may very well change their mind
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Garry: But they dont
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Garry: where are they?
[4:31 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: not in this shitty irelevant discord
[4:31 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: is where they are
[4:31 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We don't know if they would accept the new system
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Garry: If they actually COULD appear, I am sure Drhorror could mobilize them and tell them to back him here
[4:31 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Well then where are they
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >4craft go button has been on for 24 hours(edited)
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Garry: But they are not here.
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Finch: so whoever has most on launch day wins?
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >"WHERES EVERYBODY AT"(edited)
[4:31 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: like
[4:31 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: just how retarded
[4:31 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: are you
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: what, show up in the middle of the night to a fucking strawpoll thats only open for a few hours?
[4:31 PM] /mlp/ Garry: It's funny how 3 leaders of old order are here
[4:32 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We can't make decisions based on imaginary people
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: but it's somehow too early to judge
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: because not everyone came
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: YOU came, nobody else
[4:32 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We are all for Garry except the old leaders
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Newfags are here because of the threads
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I think that says everything
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Oldfags need to be contacted.
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: yeah, threads on /mlp/
[4:32 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Do it then
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: thats because not everyone cares about discord
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: you know, WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS FACTION?
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: /mlp/ people
[4:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: not your circlejerk
[4:33 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: ^
[4:33 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: That's like saying /a/ actually uses /a/.
[4:33 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: And they're the best group in 4craft
[4:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: OK pulling out of this for now
[4:33 PM] /mlp/ Garry: this isn't about /a/ though.
[4:33 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: The memes are to thick
[4:33 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Strutting told us that this is how they've always been organized
[4:33 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: In a hierarchy
[4:33 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: With good leaders
[4:33 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: You can only get so good at Minecraft
[4:34 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >isn't about /a/
[4:34 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >use analogy referring to how important board attendance is
[4:34 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: >brushes it off
[4:34 PM] /mlp/ Garry: ah, here come meme arrows
[4:34 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Wow, bitching about meme arrows in  4chan discord?
[4:34 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: the vote you held means nothing when you only held it the group of people you came here with, the best time to hold any poll is right before this shit starts that way everyone is here.
[4:35 PM] /mlp/ Garry: by the time shit starts we'll need organization, not a poll
[4:35 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: He did not come here with people, most of the newfags got here before he came on
[4:35 PM] /mlp/ Garry: True.
[4:35 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Which makes him a hypocrit.
[4:35 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Wtf
[4:35 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: No
[4:35 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: How

[4:35 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Currently
[4:36 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Drhorrorshow is winning votes now
[4:36 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: He claimed he came here because he heard /mlp/ was in trouble, but then bitches about people being here not from the thread on /mlp/.
[4:36 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Im still in 3rd place

[4:36 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Its almost like the old fags started voting
[4:36 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Well fuck, if Horror can do what he needs to
[4:36 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: What even happened

[4:40 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: we have enough people without you

[4:42 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: >Taking the bait
[4:42 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: All he does is repeat the same things with the same reasons, with hardly anybody to vouch for him
[4:42 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Just
[4:42 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Don't reply?

[4:44 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: he got shit in 2016
[4:44 PM] /mlp/ fapsnhaps: he was fine before then
[4:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: So, Janxy, what's your plan?
[4:52 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Well first off figure out who actually is competnet
[4:52 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: The rest go into the mines
[4:52 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Or the farms
[4:53 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: Get back in the mines cucky
[4:55 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Dr, what'd it take for you to yield? We can compromise.
[4:56 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: You act like everyone everywhere knows or cares about discord, let alone the 4craft discord, also do you really expect me to keep tabs on everyone after an iteration of 4craft ends and they leave?
My point is no one except your circlejerk and my circlejerk cares about this and the vast majority of people only come around to play 4craft when it's actually happening. 
We already have a long established stable chain of command, you can't just come in here and demand leadership of the faction thats how you destablize everything like it is now, 4craft faction leadership has always been on a first come first serve basis and we were here first, 2 years ago in fact. Any sort of changes you want to make we are happy to hear, but you have to do it under us, it's just the simplest course of action.
[4:56 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I hear you want control of the builders.
[4:56 PM] /mlp/ Garry: you were here for previous iteration. Doesnt mean you are here for this one
[4:56 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: but it does

[5:02 PM] /mlp/ Anthuny: Just because they might not doesn't mean they won't.

[5:09 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: It's that simple
[5:09 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Precisely
[5:10 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: You keep asserting that the silent majority will rise up
[5:10 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Yeah, because the house voted for the guy to say he owned it

[5:10 PM] /mlp/ Garry: this is /mlp/ faction

[5:17 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: Incorrect
[5:17 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Shhh
[5:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Plenty correct.

[5:23 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: That's the plan
[5:23 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Let them sit in their corner
[5:23 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Possibly all change to some board with 0 reps if they get the /mlp/ name
[5:23 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I believe the "mad cuz bad" argument is pretty accurate in this case
[5:24 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Like /k/

[5:41 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Cib, who do you support
[5:41 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Get them in here, we aren't propagandizing the Steam group
[5:41 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Should start though
[5:41 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: The steam group is ltiearrly the primary way 4craft hasbeen organized
[5:41 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Since its beena  thing
[5:41 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Resepct the steam group
[5:41 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: ALL HAIL THE STEAMGROUPS
[5:41 PM] /mlp/ Cib21: gratler, frenchie, and Drhorror
[5:41 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: ye
[5:41 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: discord is just a coty forced meme
[5:42 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: I mean it works great
[5:42 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: >Frenchie
[5:42 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Disocrd works very well for 4craft
[5:42 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Not gona lie
[5:42 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: T-thanks
[5:42 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Was Auschwitz that good?
[5:42 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I thought it was cool while I was there
[5:43 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Bunch of stuff to work with
[5:43 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: It was good until we had the super long hiatus, mlpcraft v2 was our prime
[5:43 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Then our glorious base was blown up by an insider
[5:43 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Notice there is no option to vote "no", and furthermore it's incredibly onesided and doesn't represent our side at all
[5:43 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: You guys watch CNN?
[5:43 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: The base we made after was even better though
[5:44 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: CNN is a bunch of biased liberal bullshit
[5:44 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: My point exactly
[5:44 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: They are just like that
[5:44 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I think a better question is 'who goes out of their way to rig a poll for the leader of a 4chan minecraft faction'
[5:45 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: No one
[5:45 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Since Im in 3rd place
[5:45 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Or even better, 'who needs to worry this much about it to argue and riot the poll for the leader of a 4chan minecraft faction'
[5:45 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: You clearly care too much about this, it isn't about who would be best, it's about retaining power
[5:45 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: True voice of the poeple
[5:45 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: @/tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes You know, you can still have power even if you didn't win
[5:45 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: I am the man you need to ride your horeses
[5:45 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: The slots are still open for lead positions, just not #1
[5:46 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: You can still help organize and shit
[5:46 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: so
[5:46 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: what will you guys do
[5:46 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: And frankly we all think Garry is a good #1
[5:46 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: when you get curbstomped by a faction
[5:46 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: any backup plans
[5:46 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Grab all the remaining shit and make a better one
[5:46 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: ... A leads to Z how?
[5:46 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Same thing anybody does
[5:47 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: That isn't the main thing, and we aren't talking specific plans here
[5:47 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: The chances of us getting raided, however, are slim enough
[5:47 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We mainly want organization so we can stand a better chance
[5:47 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: not really
[5:47 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: And use our manpower more effectively
[5:47 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: at this point the /a/ bogey man is dead
[5:47 PM] /mlp/ Cib21: >/mlp/
>not getting raided
[5:47 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: so eyes turn back to horse cancer
[5:47 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Well then shit, all the better to wreck them before theu wreck us with
[5:48 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: After /mlp/ gets attacked I will rally everyone under the banner of /mlp/ auschwitz
[5:48 PM] /mlp/ Cib21: always the first faction after all the little ones get stomped out for being too small(edited)
[5:48 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: If leadership is knocked out that is
[5:48 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: I would get behind seeing Auschwitz appear and take on 4craft
[5:48 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: This is meant to prevent that, by coordinating our shit
[5:48 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Considering it was the top faction in /mlp/
[5:48 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Has the old leadership proven to be able to stop that...?(edited)
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Dr's group will definitely be one of the smaller factions
[5:49 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: like there's a reason 4craft lasts 1-2 weeks
[5:49 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: bases get leveled
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: since bots cant really fight in PvP
[5:49 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: completely
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Garry: They are pretty good at fucking up polls tho
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: That's the thing
[5:49 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: babbycrafts
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Don't have anything to flatten
[5:49 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: dont apply here
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Drhorror's group will honestly be barely worth mentioning
[5:49 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: They will be kings without a kingdom
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: You can build underground or in the ocean and have a much better chance
[5:49 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Let them fuck about
[5:49 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Plus all the other things you can do to a base
[5:49 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: ocean = hybrid downwards cannons
[5:50 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Every man counts, hopefully they might see the light sooner or later
[5:50 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Bob they wont listen
[5:50 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: They thing the bbycrafts meta
[5:50 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: ye
[5:50 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Actually applies
[5:50 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: We have 11 our of their 17 players, and more people will grow to come, and if they get mad and try to pull something, we can go and noscope them
[5:50 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: way too dilusional with muh politics
[5:50 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: 4craft is the isngle most autistic server outside of 2b2t
[5:50 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: I honestly prefer building near bedrock like our v2 mlpcraft base
[5:50 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Can't do that, for reasons
[5:50 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We'd need to build surfaxe
[5:50 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: That can all be delegated though
[5:51 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Have the right people doing the right things
[5:51 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: ^ Building on bedrock/worldborder is a good idea, because one of the walls would be invincible tbh
[5:51 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: No fac protection down at low levels
[5:51 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: What would fac protection cover again?
[5:51 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Doors and chests and shit?
[5:52 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: They cannot break blocks
[5:52 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: They patched that into the newer version of factions?
[5:52 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Low or high
[5:52 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Anyone can build under a certain height or above a certain height
[5:52 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Ah
[5:52 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: So surface level or floating autism cubes
[5:52 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: I liked our underwater base though
[5:52 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Covered in obsidian and water
[5:52 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: With the obsidian trap lever door
[5:52 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Obsidian around vital rooms(edited)
[5:53 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Obsidian can't be pushed or pulled
[5:53 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: No, you have dispensers with lava and water
[5:53 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Shit hits the fan and you pull the lever
[5:53 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Traps and shit are necessary, but we can leave all that to the old guys who know their stuff
[5:53 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Enemy can't get in your new sealed door
[5:54 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: what about when they claim over you land
[5:54 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Technically, we could build an obsidian generator right behind the obsidian wall so that they wouldn't even be able to do shit
[5:54 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Ooh, an instant obsidian constructor huh
[5:54 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Yeah
[5:54 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Even if they claimed
[5:54 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Or get water inbetween a wall
[5:54 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: ^ TNT protection is always fun
[5:54 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Like a layer, then water, then another layer

We Are Number One, but it's live and performed by the real actor...


[5:54 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: If that even works, I need to look that over
[5:55 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Oh fuck
[5:56 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: Or say fuck it, build a huge sky base, and spend all our time on the offense by beating the shit out of everyone so nobody can do anything but stare at the giant sky base
[5:57 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: If Supcom has taught me anything it's that we will win by constantharassment

[6:03 PM] /mlp/ Manhorse: No experience is what we're looking for, in terms of being old cor
[6:13 PM] /mlp/ Garry: It's not.
[6:13 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: As you can see the majority doesn't know what good for them
[6:13 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: it's not about discord, it's about who leads the faction
[6:13 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: This leader shit isn't about power and honor, it's about getting a good guy

[6:14 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: You don't even know any of the previous leaders and you wrote them off instantly
[6:14 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: Jinxy?
[6:14 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Dreadger, do you think a person who runs around waking up old people to try and justify his leadership is a fit choice for leader?
[6:14 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: is that you?
[6:14 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: WOUNDED
[6:14 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: No im not heyitsjinx

[6:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Dr is not the leader.
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ deathtrap: Lord dr is leader
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ CP Express: Dr is leader
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: yes he is garry you fuck
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: No he isn't
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ CP Express: DR 4 PREZ
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ CP Express: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[6:15 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Why
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Nobody wants him but his cronnies that he had to run around for
[6:15 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: >garry can't cope now his narrative shaping team stopped talking
[6:15 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: kek
[6:15 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: this is not even an argument
[6:16 PM] /mlp/ Garry: It is
[6:16 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: This is the problem we were having dread :joy::joy::joy:
[6:16 PM] /mlp/ Garry: you werent even playing
[6:16 PM] /mlp/ Garry: or planning to
[6:16 PM] /mlp/ Garry: but then you come here to scream Dr is god
[6:16 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Why
[6:16 PM] /mlp/ Garry: It's clear as day you were asked to come over and otherwise don't care
[6:16 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: What has dr done
[6:16 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: no one is god garry
[6:16 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: What has he done and why should he be leader
[6:16 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Aside from "He always has been"
[6:16 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: We thrived throughout all of v6
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: ayylmountain
[6:17 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: Your base was separated from the outside by a single block of dirt in places
[6:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: What did you do
[6:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: You
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: you failed to keep the faction in check so it split into two
[6:17 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: I like how V6 was scamp the musical
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: because the faction is voting for him to be the leader
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: the actual faction, not just in discord
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I had to fix your mistakes
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: this is the actual faction
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: not has beens from god knows wher
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: GARRY WAT
[6:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Democracy is a shit idea for a small group like this anyway
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Drhorrorshow: Incorrect, you came along with a separate group
[6:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Nope
[6:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Untrue
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: I did not, you were told numerous times
[6:17 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: We got here a few hours before him
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Shows how much comprehension you have.
[6:17 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: Garry, what experince with mlp do you even have?
[6:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Me and cristo and frenchie, we are a group
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Played since v2
[6:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Why does that even matter
[6:18 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: garry who is best pony
[6:18 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: this is an important question
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Rarity of course
[6:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: How does having mlp experience translate to leadership skill
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: under what name?
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Garry: same name
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: >literally who
[6:18 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: His MC name is the same as well
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: At least we can agree on best pone Garry
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: you were in mlp faction?
[6:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Go to the archive and listen to 2 hours of autism
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: because no one knows you
[6:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: So
[6:18 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Yes I was
[6:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Fucking
[6:18 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: What
[6:19 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Well shit, sorry for not sucking up to you
[6:19 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I remember the guy from v2 and v3 tbh, he never was mod or anything
[6:19 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: So fucking what
[6:19 PM] /mlp/ Garry: even admins agree that I was around
[6:19 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: If I can find a screen of the player list I could prove it
[6:19 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: "I watched the video and I think I can do it better" -DreamMarine
[6:19 PM] /mlp/ CP Express: Believe it or not, having been there all the time means he's had the most experience with this. And experience is what a good leader needs. Most of the /mlp/ players know and have some modacum of respect for Dr. as well, meaning there will be little to no chance of betryal in the faction, as backstabbing and pointless drama is what kills a group the fastest in this game.
[6:19 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: I don't think he played in v5 or 6 tho
[6:20 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: monkey's, can you get another admin?
[6:20 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Keep listening
[6:20 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Correct, pointless drama kill groups
[6:20 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: >22 people
[6:20 PM] /sci/ MonkeysInSpace: @admin
[6:20 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Hello?
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: So who among you will be in the /tru-mlp/ faction
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Garry: there will be very much backstabbing if he gets control, as lots of people dont want him
[6:21 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: True
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: lots of people don't want you garry
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: consider it purged
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: so that argument is invalid
[6:21 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Garry has a plan and a structure
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Garry: oh, only 3 fags+old people who were told to come dont want me
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: like?
[6:21 PM] /mlk/ MemeMarine: Drhorror has the autism cube
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: a lot more then 3 mate
[6:21 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Like an entire discord server with 4 hours of plan outline
[6:22 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: Its always an autism cude
[6:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Im an admin
[6:22 PM] /mlp/ Gatler: there is no option
[6:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: Im already siding with the DRhorro faction
[6:22 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Janxy you compete for the leadership too tho
[6:22 PM] /tg/ HiJanxy Digger of  Memes: For sake of keeping old /mlp/ faction name

[6:22 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: I wonder if any of the other boards are having drama like ours
[6:22 PM] /mlp/ Dreadger: we don't know where he came from, and word is mon
[6:32 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: there's around 100-200 people who will potentially play with the old crew
[6:32 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: garry does not have this
[6:32 PM] /mlp/ Marshamllow Butthole: the only reason there is a split is beacuae you are making one garry
[6:32 PM] /mlp/ Garry: Oldfags meanwhile did nothing
[6:32 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: hence why splintering will need to happen
[6:33 PM] /mlp/ Garry: "Potentially"
[6:33 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: well yes
[6:33 PM] /bob/BobdaBiscuit: you dip

[6:33 PM] /mlp/ Frenchie: Auschwitz was ways the best on mlpcraft

[6:39 PM] /mlp/ Garry: The idea is that I will oversee a council of 3 leaders who'll manage a set group of people with specific goal. Builders and Resource-gatherers will be sign-up jobs, while warfare will be a group effort, with one man or team ensuring that everyone is at battle ready state. That'll permit everyone to participate in the raids, solve acivity problems and ensure that at all times there'll be a fighting force ready.
